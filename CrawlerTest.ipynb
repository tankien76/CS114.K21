The force declined to comment on René Hasee.Meanwhile, it has been claimed German authorities ignored warnings seven years ago that Christian B could have been involved in Madeleine's disappearance.German news outlet Der Spiegel claimed detectives had identified him as a key suspect in the case but was ignored by Germany's Federal Criminal Office in 2013.Der Spiegel reported: \"One person did submit a tip about Christian B, but the resulting report from police in Braunschweig to the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation was apparently not acted upon, much to the consternation of the local investigators.\"PROBE CONTINUESAnd Christian B has also reported to have been in the same area as five-year-old German girl Inga Gehricke when she vanished in May 2015.The little girl had been enjoying a family BBQ in woodland in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, around 50 miles from Berlin, when she vanished without a trace in chilling echoes of Madeleine's disappearance.Details of Christian B's past have emerged this week amid the new probe - with his first sex attack on a six-year-old girl in a playground in 1993 — when he was 16.He fled when the girl screamed in terror, but moments later he performed a sex act in front of another girl, aged nine.When asked what he was thinking at the time he coldly replied: “I didn’t think anything.”Most read in UK News Exclusive HAND ANDY OVER DOJ demands UK hand over Andrew to be quizzed over links to pedo Epstein LIVING IN FEAR Model's terror after thug ex who broke every bone in her face is on the run Latest PARTY DEATH RIDDLE Murder probe as missing sisters found dead in park after birthday party TEEN MONSTER Paedo, 17, filmed himself raping 18-month-old baby & groped girl, 11, in alley EVIL BRAG Maddie suspect said he wanted to 'capture something small & use it' in chatroom Exclusive ROYAL RECLUSE Queen may never return to royal duties as she'll be too unsafe in publicA psychiatrist who interviewed him warned the authorities: “He requires intensive supervision.”But he fled to Portugal before a sentence of two years in juvenile detention could be given.The suspect is currently in jail in the German city of Kiel serving a 21-month drugs sentence and will serve seven years for the rape if his conviction is upheld on an appeal he has lodged against the verdict.7 The American tourist said the German appeared to have enjoyed torturing her7 Maddie disappeared 18 months after the attack on the US tourist Credit: EPA\n",

She also had a young teenage girl living with her who was not her daughter. The woman would fly kids over from Germany and was supposedly running a rehabilitation programme for troubled youths.\"Christian B was named as the prime suspect in Madeleine's disappearance this week with prosecutors in Germany investigating him \"on suspicion of murder\".We are now able to show his picture in full in the UK after it was published in a German newspaper - as cops in both countries appeal for anyone who knows him to come forward.German cops have sensationally revealed they believe Madeleine is dead and know how she was killed - despite no body being found.The suspect has been branded a \"sexual predator\" who abused young girls and rapist banged up for attacking a 72-year-old tourist in Portugal.He was first thrust into the frame in 2017 after allegedly confessing to abducting Madeleine in a bar.MOST READ IN WORLD NEWS DEMOS SPREAD VIRUS Anti-racism protesters accelerated the spread of Covid, scientists warn CHURCHILL RACE ROW Why do some accuse Churchill of being a 'racist and white supremacist'?

            "SUSPECT Christian B “freaked out” as his staff discussed the Madeleine McCann case — then yelled: “The child is dead... pigs eat human flesh.”The convicted paedo’s cold outburst in 2014 appalled co-workers at the kiosk-bar he ran just yards from a school.9 Christian B's cold outburst in 2014 appalled co-workers at the kiosk-bar he ran - just yards from a school Credit: The Mega Agency9 Christian B is the prime Madeleine suspect Credit: Bild9 Madeleine McCann disappeared when she was just three-years-old Credit: PA:Press AssociationBarmaid Lenta Johlitz, 34, revealed: “Once he was completely freaked out when we were sitting talking with friends about the Madeleine case.“He wanted us to stop. He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly. Pigs also eat human flesh’.”B is suspected of snatching Madeleine from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May 2007 — and has been linked to the disappearances of at least two other children.A school caretaker in B’s hometown of Braunschweig, northern Germany, told how the fiend showered pupils with toys and teddy bears as they walked past his shop in the morning.9Peter Erdmann, 64, said: “I’d ask where they got them from and they’d say, ‘Christian at the kiosk’.“It turns my stomach now to think of his intentions. I wish I had raised what was going on with my bosses at the time.”Christian B, 43, regularly used the kiosk for drink and drugs parties, triggering complaints from the neighbours about the noise.One local, who gave his name as Norbert, recalled “strangle marks” on the neck of Christian B’s ­former girlfriend who helped run the shop.The pair lived in a nearby apartment and Norbert said: “He was often aggressive, very bad with women.“He had a girlfriend from Kosovo. He always beat her. Once I even saw her with strangle marks on her neck.9“He let the kiosk get very run-down. There were parties in the back, always plenty of alcohol and drugs.“Everything in the kiosk was filthy and he’d get aggressive if you asked for anything.“I heard that when the current owner took over from [Christian], he wanted to take the freezer and air conditioning unit with him.“But they weren’t his and he got angry and later some friends of his showed up with a knife.”Christian B is being held in a prison in Kiel, north Germany, where he is serving 15 months for drug trafficking. Asked about the Madeleine case yesterday, public prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said: “There is not enough evidence for a warrant or indictment against him.”But, chillingly, Mr Wolters added: “We assume there are other victims.”9 Maddie's suspect Christian B was convicted of child sex abuse in 1994, and again in 2016 Credit: EPAChristian B was convicted of child sex abuse in 1994, and again in 2016.He has been linked to the 2015 disappearance of Inga Gehrike, five, who vanished during a family barbecue near to where he was living at the time.He may have also been involved in the 1996 disappearance of German boy Rene Hasee, six, from a Portuguese beach close to where Madeleine ­vanished 11 years later.A source said: “It’s all circumstantial at the moment but the hope is that by putting details out there, someone will come ­forward with crucial evidence.”Under German law, Christian B can be tried in his home country if he is charged in connection with Madeleine’s disappearance.If convicted, he is unlikely to be extradited to Britain as we would have left the EU by then.German law states: “No ­German may be extradited to a foreign country. The law may provide otherwise for extraditions to a member state of the European Union or to an international court, provided that the rule of law is observed.”Seven months ago, Christian B was convicted of the 2005 rape of an American widow, 72, in Praia.MOST READ IN NEWS Exclusive HAND ANDY OVER DOJ demands UK hand over Andrew to be quizzed over links to pedo Epstein LIVING IN FEAR Model's terror after thug ex who broke every bone in her face is on the run Latest PARTY DEATH RIDDLE Murder probe as missing sisters found dead in park after birthday party TEEN MONSTER Paedo, 17, filmed himself raping 18-month-old baby & groped girl, 11, in alley EVIL BRAG Maddie suspect said he wanted to 'capture something small & use it' in chatroom Exclusive ROYAL RECLUSE Queen may never return to royal duties as she'll be too unsafe in publicHe has appealed the seven-year term and it cannot be imposed until a definitive judgment.Last night, Christian B was said to be “uncooperative” and refusing to talk with investigators.His lawyers Jan-Christian Hochmann and David Volke declined to comment.9 Little Madeleine was on holiday with her family in Portugal Credit: EPA9 Christian B was driving the campervan at the time of Maddie's disappearance Credit: PA:Press Association9 This Jaguar is also linked to him Credit: EPA\n",

SNACKS: Choccie biscuits.“I’d start on a Monday and by Saturday I’d be so hungry I’d give up.“I also tried going to the gym, but that would just make me hungrier.“I’d think, ‘I’ve earned a good dinner now’, then go home and eat a pizza with a large glass of wine.“I got married in 2008 and I weighed just over 9st and wore a size 10 dress and felt really ­confident at this size.2 The 41-year-old is now a trim 8stone 12lbs and size 8“But then things changed. We wanted a family but struggled to conceive.“We went through fertility treatment for a few years, which was tough, and I admit I comfort-ate because my focus wasn’t on my diet.“When I finally fell pregnant I was high risk, and was monitored a lot and told not to do any strenuous exercise.“I felt so anxious I didn’t do ­anything at all to put the pregnancy at risk, and I just ate without ­thinking about calories.Diet - after BREAKFAST: Overnight oats. LUNCH: Homemade soup. AFTER: Tortilla Pizza, Vodka soda and lime. SNACKS: Fruit.“When Oscar was born in December 2009 I was so relieved.“I’d put on 3st during the ­pregnancy and so, with all the worry gone, I felt like I needed to take back control of my body and lose weight — this time for good.“In January 2010 I signed up to WW, weighing 12st 8lbs and a size 16.“I wanted something long-term this time, not a quick fix. The first week was an eye-opener for me.“I could still have the foods that were familiar to me, like spag bol and pizza, but homemade versions that my husband could enjoy, too.“It took me back to basics with food and cooking and I understood that small changes made a big ­difference overall.“Swapping wine for a vodka soda and lime, or full-fat cream for light creme fraiche, for example.“I could make my favourite take-aways as fakeaways and loved the banana pancakes I cooked up at the weekends.“I lost 3st 8lb in four months and felt amazing.“I felt like me again and I felt confident and happy with all my food choices for the first time in years.“I fell pregnant again naturally in July 2010, which came as a shock.‘Positive role model for kids’“I put on weight again with this pregnancy, but this time I knew I had my WW plan to go back to after the birth, and I lost the weight back to my goal again.“I never thought I’d find a diet that became my lifestyle — as I was so used to starving myself on these awful fads, but WW is just a way of life now.Most read in Fabulous WENDYFUL Dad gets son to build his sister a playhouse & it’s so good he’s offered job in Oz WEIGH HEY The weight loss plan Adele loves - that lets you drink wine and eat chocolate SLEEP TIGHT Sleep expert reveals 5 bedtime habits and tells how to get a good night's kip LOST & FOUND I found my family after 25 years & if it wasn’t for lockdown I’d be with them DEAD SAD Human foetus mummified 2,100 years ago in Ancient Egypt 'mistaken for a bird' CHEERS TO THAT ‘Genius’ mum puts Cheerios in a blender to make edible sandpit for her baby“I can still eat out, and still cook for my whole family, I just make smart choices.“I now wear a size 8, I feel confident in who I am, and I know I’m a positive role model for my kids, which is really ­important.“I recommend WW to anyone who needs to kick-start a weight loss — I never went hungry and I’m in the best shape of my life.”Piers Morgan admits he’s ‘put on weight’ in lockdownGOT a story?

They are steamed haricot beans.These beans are harvested in North America in the summer and left out to dry, then shipped to the UK and rehydrated.The world’s biggest baked-bean factory is the 54-acre Heinz site in Wigan, Lancs, where three million cans a day roll off the production line.6 Baked beans on toast Credit: Getty Images - GettyHeinz Baked Beans were top of the pops when that album cover starring Roger Daltrey hit the shops in the Sixties.Baked beans also sealed their place in movie history with Seventies comedy Blazing Saddles, as tough-guy riders turned into guff guys by the campfire.Baked beans were first sold in the UK at posh London food store Fortnum & Mason in 1901, as a luxury.Heinz opened its Wigan plant in 1959, but also had a site in Harlesden, North West London, from the 1920s until 2000.6 There are an average of 465 beans in each 415g Heinz tin Credit: HeinzThe process from dried bean to tinned takes two hours.At Heinz, a laser checks each bean for colour and an air-jet removes any that do not quite look the part.Ingredients for the Heinz secret recipe arrive at the Wigan complex in three separate bags, which are numbered rather than labelled to keep anyone from working them out.The factory each day gets through enough tomatoes, for the sauce, to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.6 Baked beans sealed their place in movie history with Seventies comedy Blazing SaddlesThere are an average of 465 beans in each 415g Heinz tin.During the rationing in World War Two, the Ministry of Food classified baked beans as an essential food.Brummies are the UK’s No1 bean eaters, with 80 per cent feasting at least once a week. Manchester is next up, with 70 per cent tucking in, then closely followed by Sheffield and Leeds.The cheery old line “Beanz Meanz Heinz” was thought up in a London pub over a pint of beer.

He knows he is pretty much certain of leaving Chelsea at the end of this season.“He wants to do the right thing by the club too after a long time there and see the season out. But equally, he does not want to be the first one who signs before his pals have done the same.“And Willian’s situation is a bit different to his own. Willian is open to staying on at Stamford Bridge. Pedro is not keen to ‘break ranks’ and go it alone.”Highly-decorated Pedro will fall just short of his five year anniversary at Chelsea should the club make it all the way to this season’s rejigged FA Cup final on August 1.He is not only monitoring developments with his own team-mates before committing to Chelsea.Pedro is also keeping an eye on what fellow Spaniard David Silva does at Manchester City - he too is out of contract on June 30.2The Premier League kicks off again a week on Wednesday and runs until July 2.Champions League and Cup matches must also be squeezed in.And even if Chelsea finalise a £54million move for striker Timo Werner next week, the German won’t be able to play for them until next season.Previous signing Hakim Ziyech is also unlikely to figure even though he becomes a Chelsea player from the start of next month.All of which increases the importance of settled players like Willian and Pedro.Willian has not given up hope of extending his contract and staying on for another year.Chelsea boss Frank Lampard hopes a compromise on the length of contract can be thrashed out.Willian wants three years but is being offered only two.most read in football Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

That’s not stopped some players from being concerned.“Those testers may stop off on their way home to fill up with petrol, go to a supermarket, meet other people and that hikes up the risk factor.”The sixth and latest round of Premier League testing returned no positive results from 1,195 tests carried out.A Prem source insists the programme is carried out in line with NHS best practice and all testers are fully trained healthcare professionals in full PPE.The short length of time testers and players are together is also believed to reduce the risk.That will not stop some players becoming anxious at the prospect of picking up Covid-19 — even if it is a million to one chance.Watford skipper Troy Deeney is only just back training after fears of passing it to his baby who has had breathing issues.3 Troy Deeney held out on returning to Watford training over infection fears Credit: ReutersCORONAVIRUS CRISIS - STAY IN THE KNOW Don't miss the latest news and figures - and essential advice for you and your family.

            "SIGNING Timo Werner is a huge statement from Chelsea — but it would be a kick in the teeth not to make the top four now.Along with Hakim Ziyech, they have got two big-hitters through the door before the transfer window has opened.2 Timo Werner has agreed to join Chelsea in a mega £54m transfer despite the financial woes of the coronavirus shutdown Credit: EPACHELSEA NEWS LIVE: Follow for the latest Blues newsI am certain there will be more to come, too, with Ben Chilwell also on their radar.But these players will all be expecting to play in the Champions League next season, so it’s imperative they get the job done.With a three-point cushion in fourth it would be a real anti-climax if they didn’t, considering the talent on the way in.If Manchester City are banned from European football next season, then fifth place might do it.Whether they do make it or not, Frank Lampard’s squad is looking in great shape.And in Werner, they’ve got someone who a lot of other top teams in Europe wanted.At 24, he’s the perfect age, his international career is taking off, and he will without a doubt add something special.His record at RB Leipzig is brilliant and he looked like he’d never been away after coming back and scoring a hat-trick against Mainz to take him past 30 goals this season.But he’s no one-season wonder, having scored more than 20 goals in all competitions in three of the last four campaigns.With pace to burn alongside an eye for goal, Werner is comfortable anywhere across the front three, with his trademark coming in off the left to strike.At £54million, it’s a lot of money considering the climate we are now in and they will have to pay him a big salary.With Ziyech too — we saw what he can do when Ajax reached the Champions League semi-final last year — Frank has some great options now.Tammy Abraham has adapted really well in his first full season at Chelsea, so Werner doesn’t have to play as the main striker.To go alongside some brilliant English youngsters — who I’m sure Frank will stick with — there is a very exciting team being assembled at Stamford Bridge.Because of how he spoke at the time, we all knew how disappointed Frank was at not bringing in any signings in January — particularly after fighting the transfer ban.With the Eden Hazard money kept in the bank until now, owner Roman Abramovich has backed his man.And Chelsea may even look back and say that the ban worked in their favour.Frank ended up getting the job when he may not have done otherwise, then having to shuffle his pack and play a lot of the youngsters.If they were able to splash the cash, then the likes of 21-year-old Mason Mount, Reece James just 20, and Fikayo Tomori and Abraham — both 22 — might not have had as many opportunities.2 It’s no surprise to me to see young, exciting talent across the world wanting to work under Frank.After doing well at Derby, he’s had a very good start to life at Chelsea.And given the circumstances — losing Hazard, not being able to spend last summer, making no January signings — finishing in the Premier League’s top four would cap a great first year.The way they are going, I doubt very much that Werner will be their last signing.Given the situation football finds itself in, there are going to be clubs that are going to have to cut their cloth accordingly, cashing in on their assets.On the other side, though, certain clubs are not going to be stopped from spending.Chelsea are the first to strike and it will be fascinating to see how others respond.most read in football Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

            "THE US has officially demanded Britain hand over Prince Andrew to be quizzed over his links to billionaire pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.And in a bombshell move, the Department of Justice has formally told the UK the Duke of York is now caught up in a criminal probe for the first time.14 Credit: Getty14 The Duke of York has so far refused to talk to New York prosecutors investigating pedophile Epstein's historic sex trafficking network Credit: Jae Donnelly14 Credit: Nicholas RazzellAndrew, 60, has so far refused to be quizzed by New York prosecutors investigating Epstein’s evil historic sex trafficking network but strongly denies any wrongdoing.Until now it was thought he was only likely to be the target of action by Epstein’s victims in the US civil courts.One - Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now 36 - alleges she had sex with Andrew on three occasions between 2001 and 2002, twice while underage. However Andrew denies this.But now The Sun can reveal the US Department of Justice has dramatically upped the stakes.It has by-passed Buckingham Palace - instead filing a “mutual legal assistance” (MLA) request to the Home Office.MLA requests are only used in criminal cases under a legal treaty with the UK.It means Andrew, who “categorically denies” any wrongdoing, could now be forced to appear in a UK court as a witness within months.The move also piles pressure on the Duke to give evidence - and on the UK Government to assist.'DIPLOMATIC NIGHTMARE'The Sun understands no decision on the explosive request has yet been made by British officials.And sources said it was unlikely Andrew would be aware of the MLA request at this stage because countries are legally obliged to keep them secret.But a source said: “It’s a huge statement of intent from the US and it moves Andrew into the realms of a criminal investigation.“It’s also frankly a diplomatic nightmare.14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14 Credit: PA:Press Association“The DoJ does not make a request of this nature lightly, especially one involving a senior member of the British royal family.“It puts the UK government in a very difficult position - and the Duke of York even even more so.”The Sun has learned the request was formally lodged by the DoJ last month under the terms of a 1994 MLA treaty.If granted, US prosecutors would have two options.The first, typically only used for witnesses to crimes, would see the Duke asked to voluntarily attend an interview and give a signed statement. Crucially, this would NOT be under oath.The DoJ does not make a request of this nature lightly, especially one involving a senior member of the British royal family.But sources say angry American investigators - frustrated at what they see as a lack of cooperation from the Queen’s son to date - have the power to pursue an explosive second route.That would see Andrew asked to attend London’s City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court to provide oral or written evidence on oath.If he refused, the Duke could be forced to attend in person by summons, with DoJ lawyers able to quiz him.Andrew, unlike the Queen, does not hold sovereign immunity from prosecution.But any evidence session could be held “in camera” - privately, with no press or public present.He would still have the right to “take the Fifth” by staying silent to avoid self-incrimination.MLA requests filed to the UK in criminal matters are always dealt with by the Home Office.1414 Credit: PA:Press AssociationThey are rarely used in civil matters, but if they are, any request has to be filed to the Foreign Office instead.American legal experts have already warned that any decision by Andrew to remain silent could badly backfire.Last month ex-federal prosecutor Evan T Barr told a top US law journal: “While the Prince would retain the right to decline to testify under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the impact on his already diminished reputation would be considerable and an adverse inference could be drawn against him in the related civil litigations, leading to a possible default judgment.”CAREER IN RUINSAndrew stepped down as a senior royal after his disastrous Newsnight interview last November.It aimed to clear the air, but the “car crash” exchange with BBC presenter Emily Maitlis instead has seen his career left in ruins.During the interview, Andrew said he would help the US investigation if his “legal advice was to do so”.But in January, Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York leading the Epstein inquiry, said the Duke had “provided zero co-operation”.Two months later Mr Berman said the Duke had “now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation”.And in a hint of what was to come, Mr Berman warned: “Our office is considering its options.”Andrew’s aides hit back, insisting his lawyers had been in touch with prosecutors since the beginning of the year.Mr Berman’s office admitted there had been “communications through his attorneys”.But they said Andrew’s lawyers had made it clear he was still “not willing to submit to an interview”.14 Credit: PA:Press Association14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14The deadlock led US legal experts to warn the Prince would face “significant pressure going forward to cooperate with the US authorities”.Some even predicted the DoJ could eventually lodge an MLA request to question the Duke as a witness.Andrew has admitted being pals with Epstein since 1999 after being introduced by socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein was a guest at Ghislaine’s birthday party at Sandringham.He also attended Beatrice’s 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle, just two months after a warrant was issued for his arrest for sexual assault of a minor.Andrew and Epstein met on at least ten occasions and the Duke stayed over at Epstein’s New York mansion, Palm Beach home and on a private island in the US Virgin Islands.Alleged victim Virgina Roberts Giuffre says she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Andrew in London in 2001.She described Andrew as “sweating profusely” at Tramp nightclub before having sex at Ghislaine’s Mayfair flat.Andrew later told Newsnight a “peculiar medical condition” meant he did not sweat.And he insisted he did not go clubbing, claiming he remembered because he had been at Woking Pizza Express earlier that day.He claims he has no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre and sources close to the Prince have even suggested a photo with his arm around Giuffre at Maxwell’s flat could have been faked.Giuffre also alleges that Epstein paid her around £300 to have sex with Andrew at Epstein’s New York mansion.14 Credit: Getty14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14 Credit: ReutersIn evidence to a Florida court in 2015, she claimed to have had an orgy with Andrew and eight other girls at Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands.Epstein was jailed in Florida in 2008 after being convicted for procuring an underage girl for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.FIVE ACCUSERSJust 18 months after his release from jail in 2010, Epstein gave the Duchess of York £15,000 to pay off her debts.Andrew was pictured staying at the convicted sex offender’s New York mansion for three nights later that year.He claimed he made the trip to end the friendship face-to-face, saying it was a “convenient place to stay”.Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell last August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Five accusers want to give evidence about Andrew in US courts.Pre-trial witness subpoenas have been prepared for five cases and could be served on Andrew if he ever set foot in the US.Since stepping down as a senior royal Prince Andrew has recruited his own legal and PR teams to fight the case.He has reportedly hired Clare Montgomery QC, a top barrister who previously represented Chilean dictator General Pinochet.In the article for the respected New York Law Journal last month, Mr Barr predicted Andrew’s lawyers would view his “safest approach is to hunker down in the UK”.And the top US lawyer warned: “As a result of his BBC interview, the Prince has ‘locked himself in’ to a version of events, including some highly specific alibis, that leave him little room to adapt should new evidence come to light.“Thus, even if he does agree to testify before a grand jury or more likely participating in an informal proffer session, he risks possible perjury or false statement charges, not to mention likely leaks to the media.“Notwithstanding the fact that the Prince is a member of a royal family that enjoys close ties with the United States, he lacks any formal diplomatic or sovereign immunity and is facing a prosecutor who has already shown a willingness to pursue high profile foreign leaders such as the former President of Venezuela.”Tonight the Home Office said: “As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.”14 Credit: BBC\n",

            "SIR ALEX FERGUSON, the man who once ‘knocked Liverpool off their f***ing perch’, claimed a title-winning side should always build from a position of strength.The old Manchester United godfather would never allow a successful team to rest on its laurels and would always look to freshen things up as he amassed his 13 Premier League crowns.2 Timo Werner had been heavily linked to Liverpool Credit: AFP - GettyJurgen Klopp, by his own admission, will not be able to follow that advice as Liverpool seek to build their own dynasty of dominance in English football.These are unprecedented times as football heads out of its coronavirus lockdown with severe financial scars.But the Anfield manager’s comments to Sky Germany, addressing Liverpool’s failure to sign German striker Timo Werner, feel significant.Klopp wanted Werner and the RB Leipzig man preferred joining the Reds.Yet Chelsea met the £54million release clause and one of Europe’s most-wanted players is on his way to them instead.Before the pandemic hit, Werner would have been seen as a relative bargain.Now, nobody quite knows where the transfer market stands.Yet Klopp suggests such £50m-plus fees are difficult to justify on moral or financial grounds with wage restraint and even pay cuts still on the agenda.He said: “Discussing with the players about things like salary waivers and on the other hand buying a player for £50-60m, we have to explain.”Such reasoning also begs the question as to whether Liverpool’s decision to ask for Government furlough cash to pay non-footballing staff may have longer-term consequences than we imagined.That PR blunder in early April was reversed within a few days, with a grovelling apology by chief exec­utive Peter Moore, after it was met with widespread anger.But the fact the world’s seventh-richest club was prepared to get out the begging bowl in the first place would be thrown at them if they spent big this summer.Perhaps Klopp’s hands have been tied, partially because of that major error of judgment, made by a club always eager to declare its keen social conscience.Liverpool’s other top target, Wolves winger Adama Traore — described as \"unplayable\" by Klopp — will surely not come for a fee as cheap as Werner’s.He has three years left on his deal at his ambitious, upwardly-mobile club.So with the Reds facing a £150m-plus financial hit due to the pandemic, there seems little chance of Klopp strengthening, if he is as good as his word.Klopp’s champions-elect have enjoyed the most dominant campaign ever known in the English top flight and will doubtless secure the title within days of the Premier League’s restart.His team is relatively young, with none of his first-choice starting line-up the wrong side of 30.So there is no immediate need for a facelift — as long as you are willing to ignore Sir Alex’s edict.Manchester City — Liverpool’s only genuine domestic rivals over these past couple of seasons — face a damaging fallout if they fail to overturn a two-year ban from Uefa competition.So Liverpool will start next season as hot favourites to retain their title.But a potential resurgence for Chelsea and Manchester United is already on Klopp’s radar.2 Sir Alex Ferguson always strengthened his title-winning Manchester United teams Credit: PA:Press Association“There are all sorts of rumours about who United are going to sign, who Chelsea are going to pick,” said Klopp.“It’s rather quiet at Liverpool at the moment, I think it’s safe to say.“If you want to take it seriously and run a normal business and depend on income and have no idea how much you will earn — especially because we don’t know when we can start playing with spectators again.”United are likely to be busy in the market, with midfielders Saul Niguez of Atletico Madrid and Ajax’s Donny van de Beek both in their sights.Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is also flexing his financial muscles again.The fact the Blues were banned from making transfers last summer meant they were always likely to strengthen this summer.With Ajax’s Hakim Ziyech and now Werner in the bag, they are able to build on the good work put in by Frank Lampard and his youngsters this season.Not that Werner’s transfer has impressed everyone.most read in football Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

He was eventually diagnosed with testicular cancer and had four cycles of chemotherapy that shrank away most of the cancer.But scans revealed a tumour had attached itself to the main artery that carries blood away from the heart in Tajer's body and the inferior vena cava - the largest vein in the body.Unable to fly to Seattle to consult with specialist Mr Porter during the Covid-19 crisis, Ms Fernando settled for a more remote consultation at Guy's cancer centre.The technologies involved in the surgey have previously been used to assist surgeons operating in war zones.Ms Fernando used technology from Proximie, a company founded by Nadine Hachach-Haram, a consultant plastic surgeon and head of clinical innovation at Guy’s and St Thomas.most read in news 'YOU DESERVED IT' ‘Racist Karen’ slapped in face after 'telling woman “go back to Mexico”' Warning HORROR DEATH Mob BURN ALIVE medic from Brit uni after accusing him of witchcraft Warning DEADLY SMASH Four kids killed in 75mph joyriding horror crash as driver, 14, arrested SHOT IN THE BACK ‘Robber’ seen being shot at 20 times in the back as he ran AWAY from cops DEATH RIDDLE Fears Freemason mum missing at sea ‘was already DEAD’ in chilling final pic KILLED HOLDING KID Woman 'shot mother in the face as victim held her one-year-old son'Mr Porter told the Sunday Times this could be technology of \"the future\" while Ms Fernando described the procedure as \"pioneering\".In the operating room Ms Fernando was able to see how Porter used his fingers to indicate where incisions could be made with the robot arm.This was the first time in the UK that such a significant tumour caused by testicular cancer had been removed by a robot after attaching to the body’s two main blood vessels.\n",

The organisation Nightlife Spain had drawn up extensive guidelines for its members which advised they segment off grids on their dancefloors so revellers could have their own bit of space. Other recommendations included compulsory masks, isolation booths for DJs, more VIP areas to ensure social distancing, traffic light queues at the entrances and temperature checks.The organisation also proposed health records be developed to identify all attendees of sessions in leisure venues as a way to enhance the traceability of social contacts.

            "BRITISH police warned Portuguese detectives Madeleine McCann’s disappearance could be linked to a German-based child-trafficker - just days after she vanished.In the immediate aftermath of her vanishing, the Serious Organised Crime Agency sent an alert marked “urgent” to their counterparts working the case on the Algarve.⚠️ Click here for the latest news on Madeleine McCann6 Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007 Credit: PA:Press Association6 Christian B is the prime Madeleine suspect Credit: BildIn it they urged those searching for Madeleine to probe links to a German sex offender whose surname was given as “Meissner” but who was known to use aliases.It also said he was linked to other paedophiles - one of whom was named as Frankel.The memo said the sex-offenders were involved in trafficking.A source close to the case said these details now take on “huge significance” given the events of the past seven days.Not least because police in Germany are actively investigating the scenario that Christian B - a known German paedophile - was behind the disappearance of Madeleine.“This looks like the latest in what is emerging as a string of missed opportunities to properly investigate the case,” the source said.6“It shows that in the immediate aftermath of the disappearance the police in the UK were linking it, straight away, to a ring which led back to Germany.“This development throws up a lot of questions that need to be answered. Not least who were these men? Were they ever traced? And did they know or have any links to Christian B?\"Even now both of these individuals must be found and spoken to because they could hold vital clues about what happened to Madeleine.\"Details of the potential blunder comes amid mounting criticism of the Portuguese police’s handling of the case.It's been reported that British detectives raised concerns that Madeleine had been spotted with a German man getting into a VW van weeks after she vanished.We now know this is the make of the vehicle the Madeleine suspect drove.Files also contain a report by a witness who saw a \"strange\" man matching Christian B's description loitering in the Praia da Luz resort two weeks before Madeleine was taken.Another tourist reported seeing a \"suspicious man\" with a van of the type he drove.6 The holiday apartment complex where Madeleine went missing Credit: PA:Press Association6 The VW campervan owned by Christian BEarlier today it was reported the suspect could have dodged a police probe seven years ago after a tip to German cops identifying him was ignored.Police received the tip-off Christian B could have snatched the youngster from her bed in 2007 after an appeal by British police on German TV in 2013.A report was prepared for the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) - Germany’s FBI equivalent - by local police in his home town of Braunschweig after the call was made.But it is unclear whether the crucial tip ever reached British cops investigating Madeleine's disappearance, the Mail on Sunday reports.An acquaintance who saw the TV appeal called in after remembering Christian B from the resort where Madeleine was snatched.The report in Germany was reportedly ignored - meaning the child sex offender could have swerved a police probe as far back as 2013.This was after officers in Braunschweig were told he was a convicted sex offender who had abused a six-year-old girl on a playground.6A source told the newspaper: \"The guy that came forward after the 2013 TV appeal provided really valuable information.\"The BKA is responsible for liaising with foreign police forces and, it must be said, I cannot understand why they wouldn’t pass the information on, especially since the programme featured the McCanns and the Met officer so prominently.\"Christian B was named as the prime suspect in Madeleine's disappearance this week with prosecutors in Germany investigating him \"on suspicion of murder\".We are now able to show his picture in full in the UK after it was published in a German newspaper - as cops in both countries appeal for anyone who knows him to come forward.The Sun on Sunday also revealed today how British cops had alerted Portuguese detectives to a possible sighting of Madeleine three weeks after she vanished.Officers sent a memo explaining how a witness believed they had spotted her at a named restaurant near Valencia, Spain.The witness said she left with a man in a VW with German plates and asked for details of the owner.MOST READ IN NEWS Exclusive HAND ANDY OVER DOJ demands UK hand over Andrew to be quizzed over links to pedo Epstein LIVING IN FEAR Model's terror after thug ex who broke every bone in her face is on the run Latest PARTY DEATH RIDDLE Murder probe as missing sisters found dead in park after birthday party TEEN MONSTER Paedo, 17, filmed himself raping 18-month-old baby & groped girl, 11, in alley EVIL BRAG Maddie suspect said he wanted to 'capture something small & use it' in chatroom Exclusive ROYAL RECLUSE Queen may never return to royal duties as she'll be too unsafe in publicTwo weeks later, they asked again for the tip to be traced but archived files seen by The Sun on Sunday show no follow up.German cops have seized the VW camper van that suspect, Christian B, 43, was living in two miles from where Madeleine went missing in 2007.Christian B - born in Germany in 1976 before moving to Portugal in his late teens - has a list of convictions for sexual abuse against children, drug offences and rape.Police in Germany fear the drifter, who stole from hotels in Praia da Luz, may have snatched Madeleine after first entering the holiday home to raid it.\n",

The world is a crazy place right now with all these things going on.So if that's what Conor's feeling right now, Jon Jones, Jorge Masvidal, I feel you. On a certain level, I understand it.

I totally understand it and get it.\"4The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on finances in the sports industry.With no gate money and travel restrictions for international fighters, the UFC might need to tighten their purse strings while they ride out the Covid storm.However, this isn’t the first time the organisation has come under fire for failing to pay athletes fairly.According to reports published before the pandemic, the UFC only pays 16 per cent of its £710million revenue to fighters.In contrast, other sports bodies such as Major League Baseball or the National Football League pay between 48-50 per cent to their players.After feeling undervalued by the UFC, multiple fighters filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in 2014.They accuse the UFC of \"illegally maintaining monopoly and monopsony power by systematically eliminating competition from rival promoters, artificially suppressing fighters’ earnings from bouts and merchandising and marketing activities through restrictive contracting and other exclusionary practices\".In other words, they accuse the company of shutting down rival companies and driving down pay for fighters.4 UFC stars including 'BMF' Jorge Masvidal are paid just 16 per cent of the promotion's revenue Credit: Getty Images - GettyThe UFC has disputed these claims and insists they pay fighters fairly.

born in Germany in 1976 before moving to Portugal in his late teens - has a list of convictions for sexual abuse against children, drug offences and rape.Police in Germany fear the drifter, who stole from hotels in Praia da Luz, may have snatched Madeleine after first entering the holiday home to raid it.It comes after Christian B was linked to a forth child disappearance -

meaning the child sex offender could have swerved a police probe as far back as 2013.This was after officers in Braunschweig were told he was a convicted sex offender who had abused a six-year-old girl on a playground.A source told the newspaper: \"The guy that came forward after the 2013 TV appeal provided really valuable information.\"The BKA is responsible for liaising with foreign police forces and, it must be said, I cannot understand why they wouldn’t pass the information on, especially since the programme featured the McCanns and the Met officer so prominently.\"9Christian B was named as the prime suspect in Madeleine's disappearance this week with prosecutors in Germany investigating him \"on suspicion of murder\".We are now able to show his picture in full in the UK after it was published in a German newspaper - as cops in both countries appeal for anyone who knows him to come forward.German cops have sensationally revealed they believe Madeleine is dead and know how she was killed - despite no body being found.The suspect has been branded a \"sexual predator\" who abused young girls and rapist banged up for attacking a 72-year-old tourist in Portugal.In 2013 - the same year as the tip-off- he allegedly discussed kidnapping and sexually abusing a child in a chatroom exchange.9He said he fantasised about wanting to \"capture something small and use it for days\",German newspaper Spiegel reports.After one pal warned him it would be dangerous - causing Christian B to reply: \"Oh, if the evidence is destroyed afterwards.\"He was first thrust into the frame in 2017 after allegedly confessing to abducting Madeleine in a bar.German sources claim he boasted he had \"snatched her\" but didn’t say he had killed her.The Sun on Sunday revealed today how British cops had alerted Portuguese detectives to a possible sighting of Madeleine three weeks after she vanished.Officers sent a memo marked “urgent” explaining how a witness believed they had spotted her at a named restaurant near Valencia, Spain.9The witness said she left with a man in a VW with German plates and asked for details of the owner.Two weeks later, they asked again for the tip to be traced but archived files seen by The Sun on Sunday show no follow up.German cops have seized the VW camper van that suspect, Christian B, 43, was living in two miles from Praia da Luz — where Madeleine went missing in 2007.The files also contain a report by a witness who saw a “strange” man matching Christian B’s description loitering near apartment 5A two weeks before Madeleine was taken.Another tourist reported seeing a suspicious man with a van of the type Christian B drove.MOST READ IN NEWS Exclusive HAND ANDY OVER DOJ demands UK hand over Andrew to be quizzed over links to pedo Epstein LIVING IN FEAR Model's terror after thug ex who broke every bone in her face is on the run Latest PARTY DEATH RIDDLE Murder probe as missing sisters found dead in park after birthday party TEEN MONSTER Paedo, 17, filmed himself raping 18-month-old baby & groped girl, 11, in alley EVIL BRAG Maddie suspect said he wanted to 'capture something small & use it' in chatroom Exclusive ROYAL RECLUSE Queen may never return to royal duties as she'll be too unsafe in publicHe also took a mysterious 30-minute phonecall just one hour before the disappearance and had also rented two homes in Portugal just miles from the Ocean Club where Madeleine was staying.Christian B -

            "THE Champions League is set to be concluded with a mini-tournament in Portugal in August.Uefa are desperate to complete their premier competition amid the coronavirus pandemic.2 The Champions League could be set for an unorthodox finish in PortugalAccording to German outlet Bild, matches from the quarter-finals onwards could be switched to Portugal's capital Lisbon.They suggest the Portuguese city - which hosted the 2014 final between city rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - is the likely host after being backed by the Portuguese FA.Portugal has been among the European nations least affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, so could even allow fans into the stadium by August.Lisbon was chosen because it has several modern stadiums that are suitable to host a tournament, having staged Euro 2004.The city has both the Estadio Da Luz - home of Benfica - and the Estadio Jose Alvalade - where Sporting Lisbon play their home games.The move falls in line with Uefa's political demands and with no Portuguese sides left in the competition, it would not be seen to give an unfair advantage to any team.Frankfurt appears to be the second favourite after the German association proposed it be used to finish the tournament.But with RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich still in the running for the continent's top prize, Uefa bosses fear a German city would effectively give them home advantage.Russian footballing authorities also suggested the use of Moscow.But it is reported Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin would not consider the country due to its high number of virus cases.A location for the revised end to the tournament will be officially announced on June 17 at a Uefa meeting.The European champions were initially set to be crowned in Istanbul on May 30 but Covid-19 brought world football to a halt in March.It is claimed that Europe's governing body and the Turkish city have been in talks regarding the situation.A lack of travelling fans is likely to mean they are unable to cash in on the investment of hosting the showpiece final, allowing the unique finish to go ahead elsewhere.Four Last 16 ties are still yet to have their second leg played but Atleti, Leipzig, Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta have all booked their spot in the quarters.MOST READ IN FOOTBALL Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

            "MANNY PACQUIAO will run to be president in the Philippines in 2022, according to his former promotor Bob Arum.The boxing legend, 41, was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in late 2009, taking his role the following year.3 Manny Pacquiao could make a run for the presidency at the next election in 2022 Credit: ReutersIn 2016, he received more than 16million votes and joined the Philippine Senate, introduced as the people's champion with his name read out in the same style as before a big fight.And when his current term in office comes to an end in June 2022, the national treasure is being tipped to go for the very top job, currently occupied by Rodrigo Duterte.The election to decide his successor is set for May 9, 2022 - by which time Pacquiao will be 43.Arum told WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman: “The first president I think we’ll get as a fighter is little Manny Pacquiao, who told me, once again.“I did a Zoom telephone call with him, ‘Bob, I’m gonna run in 2022 and, when I win, I want you there at my inauguration.'”Despite his role in his national politics, Pacquiao has still not hung up his boxing gloves and is instead keeping in prime condition during the coronavirus crisis.In a staggering professional career spanning back 25 years across nine weight divisions, he has won 62 of his 71 fights.His most recent, against Keith Thurman last July, saw him claim the WBA welterweight world title.He won via a split decision and in the process became the oldest welterweight to win a major world title at the age of 40.Arum no longer represents Pac-Man but there was a suggestion he was on the Zoom call with the eight-weight world champ to discuss his next fight.Latest boxing news PARTEY STARTED Partey urged to make Arsenal switch and \"prove himself\" in another league Live Blog TOON LATEST Newcastle takeover LIVE: Staveley battle with Barclays, Bin Salman LATEST Breaking EFL HEAVEN AND HELL EFL clubs will be promoted and relegated if season is ended early Live Blog COVID IN SPORT Windies touch down for Tests, Ronnie ready to return & Prem spies on lookout Pictured 30 LOVE Ex-Wimbledon champ Ilie Nastase, 73, marries FIFTH wife who is 30 years his junior Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the EmiratesPacquiao was tipped with taking on WBO welterweight king Terence Crawford in a unification bout.Undefeated Crawford has a perfect 36-0 pro record and is nine years younger than his potential opponent.And it is thought the fight with 'Bud' could be Pacquiao's final appearance in the ring before he turns his attention to a new kind of fight - for the presidency.3 The senator became the oldest welterweight world champion when he edged out Keith Thurman last year Credit: Getty Images - Getty3\n",
            "THE trilogy fight between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder could take place in Australia - with a shock proposal to take the bout to Sydney's Bankwest Stadium having been revealed.And the showdown Down Under could take place on Boxing Day, with chiefs eager to capitalise on the US Christmas prime time TV slot.5 Sydney's stunning Bankwest Stadium has emerged as a shock contender to host Fury - Wilder 3 Credit: Getty Images - Getty5 The pair's second fight secured £13.8m in gate receipts Credit: ReutersThe fight was due to take place this summer, with the Gypsy King vowing to take Wilder's \"scalp\" again.But with the coronavirus pandemic having complicated matters, other alternatives are having to be explored.With the usual suspects in terms of venues in the US and UK extremely unlikely to be able to host a capacity crowd - the rematch could be taken to a different region of the world - with Macau having been suggested.But Bob Arum recently revealed that the fight could be taken to Australia - a country that hasn't been as badly-hit by Covid-19 as most.He told Sky Sports: \"Our friends in Australia are talking about doing this fight, probably in Sydney. That’s a possibility.\"And with the cat now out of the bag, Aussie promoter Dean Lonergan has claimed credit for the proposal.The man that brought Manny Pacquiao Down Under to fight Jeff Horn told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"When Bob came out and said that we are talking to 'our friends in Australia', I’m the one he’s talking to.I just had a thought six weeks ago that if these guys can’t do a major fight in Las Vegas or New York, why not come down here where I know we can get a crowd. Dean Lonergan\"It’s my proposal, I put it to him with budgets, how we’d do it, the whole lot.“Bob has been an incredible partner and ally for me in the world of boxing.\"I just had a thought six weeks ago that if these guys can’t do a major fight in Las Vegas or New York, why not come down here where I know we can get a crowd.“We are flexible around the timing, but if we did it at 1.30pm on Boxing Day, it would be beamed back into the States on Christmas night.”Securing that crowd will be a critical factor, with the second fight in Vegas having raked in £13.8million in gate receipts, a significant portion of the event's revenue.A 1:30pm Boxing Day start would greatly appeal to organisers for its ability to secure a huge US TV audience.Due to the time difference, the fight would begin at 9:30pm on Christmas Day in New York, and 6:30pm in Los Angeles.5It wouldn't be great news for British fight fans, however, as they would have to stay up until 2:30am on Boxing Day morning to catch the start of the bout.They may have to suck it up, however, as The Australian’s Brent Read claims that the venue has already been \"tentatively booked\" for Boxing Day.The event would mark the Bankwest Stadium's first fight, having opened in April last year.Primarily used for football and rugby, the venue boasts a capacity of 30,000 and was designed by the same company responsible for the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Being hosted in Sydney would also give the fight an extra historical and cultural significance.The last heavyweight title fight to take place there was on Boxing Day 1908 - when Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first black heavyweight title-holder.5On marking this significant milestone, Lonergan continued: \"Given what is going on around the world at the moment, what an opportunity to celebrate the first African-American to cut through in American culture.\"This is well before the days of Jackie Robinson in the 1950s, Jack Johnson was the most controversial figure of his day, bar nobody. It’s who Muhammad Ali took his lead off.\"He set the platform for African-American success in sports.“His importance has been overlooked over the past 112 years.\"What he did in 1908 was historically significant. Wouldn't it be totally amazing to get two recent heavyweight champions down here, two of the best self-promoters in the business, to celebrate Jack Johnson’s achievements from 112 years ago.”The first two Fury-Wilder fights were the biggest promotions of Arum's illustrious career, but Lonergan believes that his strong relationship with the veteran American could be key in securing the third.5 Jack Johnson (right) became the first African-American heavyweight title-holder in Sydney on Boxing Day 1908 Credit: Times Newspapers LtdLATEST BOXING NEWS Live Blog TOON LATEST Newcastle takeover LIVE: Staveley battle with Barclays, Bin Salman LATEST Breaking EFL HEAVEN AND HELL EFL clubs will be promoted and relegated if season is ended early Live Blog COVID IN SPORT Windies touch down for Tests, Ronnie ready to return & Prem spies on lookout Pictured 30 LOVE Ex-Wimbledon champ Ilie Nastase, 73, marries FIFTH wife who is 30 years his junior Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates SLY MOVE Stallone backs McGregor to become part owner of UFC and offers some of his shareHe said: \"It’s an excellent relationship, I have enormous respect for Bob since he came down here with Manny Pacquiao.\"We’ve done a few deals like when Jeff fought Terence Crawford.

            "CHELSEA-BOUND Timo Werner is \"not good enough for Liverpool\", believes Kop hero Robbie Fowler.The two Premier League sides were both keen on landing the RB Leipzig striker, 24, this summer.3 Robbie Fowler does not think it is a major blow for Liverpool to miss out on Timo Werner, who looks set to join Chelsea Credit: EPAWerner even described the Reds as the \"best team in the world\" and thought he would be a \"good fit\" at Anfield while it is understood he had a virtual meeting to discuss the transfer with boss Jurgen Klopp.Liverpool were forced to pull out of the race, though, due on financial grounds - they simply could not stump up the £53million to activate the German's release clause.Chelsea, however, look on course to do so and are confident Werner will be their player next season.But Fowler, who scored 183 goals for Liverpool, does not think it is a major blow for his former side.Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Fowler said: \"I’ve heard the noise ­surrounding Timo Werner in recent weeks – but I’m not a big fan.\"I realise he’s a talented player, he has moments of real brilliance in matches that underline his quality.\"But I stand by this: is Werner up to the standard of Liverpool’s current front three?

I’ve watched him a fair few times and there are things about his game I like and admire.\"But does he influence games consistently enough? Not for me. Does he match up to the players you are signing him to challenge and replace? Not at Liverpool. Maybe at Chelsea.\"Werner's release clause of ‎€60m - currently around £53m when converted - expires this month.And Fowler reckons if Werner really was the real deal, all of Europe's top clubs would be fighting hard for his signature, even amid the coronavirus crisis with finances unknown.Instead, the former England striker believes Chelsea are panic buying an unproven striker - who incidentally has scored 31 goals this season including three hat-tricks and four in the Champions League.Fowler added: \"I’ve heard so many people ­complaining about Liverpool owners not splashing the cash, not diving in on ­Werner when he’s a ‘steal’ at £52million. Is he really, though?\"This is the reality – all those other clubs, Barcelona, Liverpool, Juventus, Real Madrid, Man City and United have looked at him and thought, in the current market, his release clause fee is too high.\"How do we know that? Because otherwise they would have activated it.\"We’ve seen it before with clubs struggling a tiny bit – they pay over the odds to get players. City had to do that for a while, Chelsea themselves too.\"At times, Liverpool have done that over the past two decades. It rarely worked for them.\"I'm not saying Werner is a flat-track bully, but I do think there are clearly doubts about him from all the top clubs with all their sophisticated ­analysis that tells them exactly what a player is worth.\"I’m not sure the fuss is worth it about Werner. I’m not sure he’s a Liverpool player.\"Despite a five-year contract worth £200,000 per week looking on the verge of completion, the deal may not be as close as previously thought.RB Leipzig chief Oliver Mintzlaff threw a spanner in the works on Saturday.Latest Premier League news Breaking EFL HEAVEN AND HELL EFL clubs will be promoted and relegated if season is ended early Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates Gossip TIME TO SELL UP Arsenal have three weeks to land RB Leipzig's Upamecano for £53m NEW BLUES How Chelsea will line up with Werner and Havertz but without Kante and Jorginho Gossip ROC THE BOAT Arsenal fight AC Milan for midfielder Marc Roca, 23, as Espanyol want £35m fee Gossip CHIES CHASE Utd ‘in pole position’ to beat Chelsea to Chiesa as Fiorentina set £60m priceMintzlaff said: “We have not had an exchange with Chelsea yet.

Credit: Getty8 Conor McGregor had looked in great shape before his shock retirementHowever, this isn’t the first time the star has claimed he is walking away from the sport, and many fans aren’t convinced we have seen the last of him.Here's what we could see next from the MMA superstar...Business VenturesThe athlete may be leaving combat sports to focus on his other business endeavours.McGregor has built a whiskey empire with his product, Proper No Twelve.8 McGregor has a number of business interests, including his whiskey empire Credit: Getty - ContributorHe also has other lines of income including his successful clothing line, August McGregor, not to mention his Instagram account which is a hotspot for sponsorships and product endorsements.Despite only fighting once in the last 12 months, his various income streams meant the star was able to make the Forbes “World’s Highest-Paid Athletes” list of 2020.The Irishman has certainly found a pot of gold under the rainbow with his other business ventures and this could be the reason for his retirement.The World Of Entertainment8 Could McGregor join Tyson Fury in swapping his sport for WWE? Credit: WWEMcGregor could swap fighting for the bright lights of Hollywood.Famous UFC stars like Randy Couture have transitioned into entertainment with successful roles in films such as The Expendables.Other fighting legends have combined acting with fighting and joined the world of wrestling.Even boxing legend Tyson Fury threw it down in the WWE cage in 2019 and has hinted at another future appearance.McGregor is yet to enter the WWE and previously called out the athletes as \"dweebs\".While a WWE appearance may be off the cards, he did appear in front of the camera for the 2017 film, The Notorious.The sports documentary followed McGregor’s life over four years and his meteoric rise to UFC stardom.Future TV or film appearances could be on the horizon for the charismatic star.A Mega-Fight U-Turn8 McGregor had been a promised a rematch against Khabib down the line Credit: GettyMcGregor could make a shocking U-turn for the right fight and the right price.In fact, many fans were taken back by the 31-year old's surprising return to face Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone this year at UFC 246.Before that, McGregor had announced his retirement and hadn’t fought for several months, since his 2018 loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov.His return to face Cerrone worked in his favour as the Notorious returned delivered a show-stopper TKO finish in the first round.Notorious could be lured into the Octagon once again for the right matchup.Rumours have circulated that the star could collide against MMA legend, Anderson Silva.Welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman has also outlined his willingness to fight the Irish prospect.If McGregor could beat Usman for the 170-pound belt, he would be the first fighter in UFC history to claim three belts from three different divisions.A blockbuster rematch against \"The Eagle\" Nurmagomedov could also tempt McGregor into a possible return.However, the current lightweight champion is interested in defending his title against lightweight prospects Tony Ferguson or Justin Gaethje.Floyd Mayweather Showdown8 Mayweather came out of retirement to defeat Conor McGregor to earn a massive payday - could they fight again? Credit: PA:Press AssociationIf McGregor is done with MMA for good, Floyd Mayweather might be the answer.The former UFC champion faced the undefeated Mayweather in his first professional boxing bout in August 2017.Despite McGregor's undeniable striking abilities, the boxing world champion ultimately schooled his opponent, sealing the 10th round TKO win.Softening the blow of a disappointing loss, McGregor pocketed one of the biggest paycheques of his career and might be tempted by another possible showdown.In fact, after Mike Tyson revealed his plans to return to the ring, McGregor revealed his plan to rematch Mayweather once and for all.Last month, the 31-year old promised Mike Tyson that he will avenge his boxing match loss to Mayweather in a rematch.Sharing Is Caring8 Conor McGregor could spend more time with his family Credit: https://www.instagram.com/thenotoriousmma/McGregor might be serious about hanging up his MMA gloves for good.If he is, then what better way to reap the rewards of his career than by sharing them with friends and family.In his official retirement announcement, the star used the opportunity to show some love to his mother, Margaret McGregor.The athlete has a collection of mega-mansions around the globe where he stays with his family and long-term partner Dee Devlin.8Despite numerous cheating allegations, the pair are still going strong and share two young children together.McGregor also helps those in need. Recently, the athlete donated £860,000 to Irish hospitals to battle the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this month, he posted his support for the Black Lives Matter movement and advocated for an end towards racism.Time away from the Octagon may give McGregor the time to focus on his other passions such as charity work and spending time with his family.\n",

            "MANCHESTER UNITED are likely to miss out on Jude Bellingham as the teenage starlet's father preferring a transfer to Borussia Dortmund, according to reports.The 16-year-old has been on the Red Devils' radar all season, having burst on to the scene at Birmingham City back in August.3 Bellingham has impressed with his mature performances in the Championship this season Credit: Getty Images - GettyHe would appear to fit United's bill perfectly, as an exciting young British talent.But according to The Mirror, the midfielder's father Mark believes that a move to Borussia Dortmund would be better for Jude's \"football education\".The player's camp are keen for him to continue getting regular exposure to first-team football, even after stepping up a level.Since making his senior Blues debut in the League Cup back in August, Bellingham has racked up 35 appearances in total for Pep Clotet's side - despite not turning 17 until later this month.While getting first-team minutes at Old Trafford immediately would seem a tall order, there may be more of a quick path to playing time in the Bundesliga.Jadon Sancho is the obvious example of a teenage star getting ample first-team opportunities over the last couple of seasons at BVB - but he is not the only one.At 17, Gio Reyna has been making significant waves for Lucien Favre's side this season - while teenage import Erling Haaland has also made incredible strides in a short period of time.Chelsea star Christian Pulisic was another to be trusted early on, making his Dortmund debut at just 17 as well.3Despite Bellingham having not committed to signing his first professional contract with Blues in three weeks' time, the Championship side are believed to be relaxed about the situation.Release figures over a potential transfer, dependent on first-team appearances, are believed to have been inserted into his current scholarship contract.Which will guarantee Birmingham a handsome fee for their star asset, whether or not he signs a pro deal.MAN UTD NEWS LIVE: Follow for the latest United news3 The midfielder has scored four times this term Credit: PA:Empics SportMOST READ IN FOOTBALL Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

The more people there are, the more food there is for the rats.”Female rats can fall pregnant immediately after giving birth and can produce seven litters per year with up to eight babies each time.2 The rodents gather together in colonies and even eat each other Credit: Getty Images - GettyThey can also mate up to 500 times with randy males in the space of a few hours.Professor Steven Belmain, of Natural Resources Institute in Greenwich, has also recorded an increase in rodents in suburban homes which he blames on a lack of food in city centres.He also said that hunger has made the ravenous rats more brazen meaning they are seen more and more during the day.Speaking about the rats fighting each other, he said: “They are quite territorial, so will defend their patches as much as they can.”While rats do not carry Covid-19, they can spread other zoonotic diseases including Weil’s disease – a bacterial infection which can cause chills and headaches.Most read in News 'YOU DESERVED IT' ‘Racist Karen’ slapped in face after 'telling woman “go back to Mexico”' Warning HORROR DEATH Mob BURN ALIVE medic from Brit uni after accusing him of witchcraft Warning DEADLY SMASH Four kids killed in 75mph joyriding horror crash as driver, 14, arrested SHOT IN THE BACK ‘Robber’ seen being shot at 20 times in the back as he ran AWAY from cops DEATH RIDDLE Fears Freemason mum missing at sea ‘was already DEAD’ in chilling final pic KILLED HOLDING KID Woman 'shot mother in the face as victim held her one-year-old son'Professor Belmain believes that while some of the vermin will migrate back to the cities once the lockdown is over, many colonies will continue to expand in the suburbs.He said: “What is happening is they are moving into residential areas and finding food sources there, so deciding to make it home.“Some people are telling me they are having real problems.”\n",

            "CHINA knew Covid-19 was a “clearly contagious” coronavirus in December yet failed to inform global health authorities, a new report shows.At least five laboratories in the country confirmed the existence of the deadly bug yet Beijing did not tell officials at the World Health Organisation for another TEN days.3 Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - located in the city where Covid-19 first jumped from animals to humans Credit: AP:Associated PressThe regime also waited until January 20 to admit that the coronavirus could be transmitted from human to human, The Mail on Sunday reports.One team in China found that the virus was “clearly contagious” while another lab unravelled its genetic make-up – key to developing tests and vaccines.Yet President Xi's government stayed silent.Now, the respiratory disease has spread around the world killing nearly 400,000 and counting.Lianchao Han, a pro-democracy activist, said: “China knew the new virus was prevalent last December but failed to inform the public or share with the international community.CHINESE 'COVER UP'“Its irresponsibility has probably worsened this pandemic.”The new evidence was uncovered by independent media Caixin.According to their investigation, nine samples from patients had already been sent to labs in the countries before December 31 when China told the WHO of a “pneumonia-like” disease.One doctor in Wuhan claims that one of the laboratories in Guangzhou phoned up the hospital after running tests on samples taken from a 65-year-old hospitalised on Dec 18.The medic said: “They just called us and said it was a new coronavirus.”3 Members of the Chinese military holding drill marches. China has been accused of attempting to cover up the outbreak Credit: Getty Images - GettyA social media post from a researcher in Guangzhou said scientists instantly knew the new pathogen resembled the Sars-coronavirus which caused an outbreak in 2003, Caixin reports.The report claims the lab “assembled a nearly complete viral genome sequence” on Dec 27 and passed their finding to Chinese authorities.Another lab found how the virus was transmitted while a third found it was similar to Sars after carrying out gene-sequencing on a sample on Dec 29.Last week, leaked recording from WHO meetings revealed health officials' shock over Beijing's failure to release data immediately.At least one study has found that if the communist regime had acted three weeks earlier, it would have cut infected cases by 95 per cent.In May, a spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.3 A wet market in Guangzhou, China, selling turtles for food. The Covid-19 outbreak is believed to have started at a market in Wuhan Credit: EPAA 15-page document, obtained by Australia's The Saturday Telegraph, laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.It has also been revealed that a laboratory in Wuhan, not far from the now infamous wet market, had been studying deadly bat-derived coronaviruses.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that China's secrecy surrounding the virus led to an \"assault on international transparency\".Another report claims the CIA believes China threatened the WHO into delaying warnings about Covid-19 while it hoarded medical supplies.'PRESSURE ON WHO'According to the document, Beijing told the World Health Organisation they would stop working with them if the agency declared a global health emergency.The alleged pressure in January enabled China to stockpile crucial medical equipment while the coronavirus - which started in Wuhan late last year - spread around the world, reports Newsweek.Two US intelligence sources confirmed the contents of the CIA report, titled 'U.N.-China: WHO Mindful But Not Beholden to China,' to Newsweek.Most read in News Warning HORROR DEATH Mob BURN ALIVE medic from Brit uni after accusing him of witchcraft 'YOU DESERVED IT' ‘Racist Karen’ slapped in face after 'telling woman “go back to Mexico”' Warning DEADLY SMASH Four kids killed in 75mph joyriding horror crash as driver, 14, arrested SHOT IN THE BACK ‘Robber’ seen being shot at 20 times in the back as he ran AWAY from cops DEATH RIDDLE Fears Freemason mum missing at sea ‘was already DEAD’ in chilling final pic MAKING THEM PAY Kobe’s wife seeks hundreds of millions in damages over chopper crash deathA third intelligence report, this time from German spies, claims Xi Jinping personally pressured the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus into downplaying the risk of the virus.Newspaper Der Spiegel cited sources from Munich's Federal Intelligence Service, known as the 'Bundesnachrichtendienst' (BND).The WHO has branded the claims “unfounded and untrue.”\n",

If you struggle to get to sleepWe might all occasion have a restless night here and there, but if it happens frequently Olivia said you might want to re-think your sleep.She said: \"This could mean that you're doing insufficient healthy sleep activities like you don't have a relaxing routine the hour before you go to bed.\"4 You should be able to fall asleep with ease Credit: AlamyThe expert said that it could also mean you're doing \"sleep sabotaging\" activities - like watching TV before bed, napping too late in the day or having caffeine or chocolate in the afternoon.She explained: \"In the absence of light, you produce melatonin — helping you stay asleep. In the presence of light, you produce cortisol — helping you stay awake. Whilst this is ideal during the day, it's obviously not in the evening.\"She suggests limiting time on your phone in the evenings, but if it's persists, she says to a hormone imbalance could be the reason - \"driven by conditions such as PCOS, an overactive thyroid, depression and anxiety disorders\".2. If you wake up in the middle of the nightYou might fall asleep right away but waking up in the middle of the night is also a bad sign, and Olivia says stress is often to blame.Feeling anxious or having trouble switching off can still affect you even after you doze off because stresses increase the levels or cortisol in your body.4 Olivia explains what you can do to get better sleep Credit: oliviaarezzolo/Instagram\"Cortisol levels naturally spike due to your circadian rhythm, which means if you're stressed out and have higher than normal levels of cortisol (or if you're going through menopause), you'll wake up,\" Olivia said.The expert said it could also mean you're drinking too much alcohol with Olivia saying, despite alcohol being a sedative, it often has a \"rebound effect\" and can \"wake you up with a flurry of thoughts.\"3. If you power through on just a few hours' sleepSome people feel they only need a few hours sleep but Olivia explained that the concept of \"powering through\" is largely a fallacy.\"Sleep deprivation impairs the frontal lobe, responsible for decision making, judgement and mental productivity,\" she said, so even if you feel invincible, Olivia says \"you are likely to be slower as a result of too little sleep\".And added: \"Because your judgement is impaired, you won't always realise that you're being inefficient,\" meaning you work could be slipping and you don't even realise it.The answer is to prioritise sleep and aim for between seven to nine hours every night.4 Lack of sleep slows you down Credit: Getty Images - Getty4. If you wake up feeling foggy regardless of how much sleep you getBrain fog is common for a lot of people - and it often comes back to your sleep and hydration.The sleeping guru says that \"brain fog can be attributed to a number of factors\" and dehydration is one that's often overlooked.She explained: \"Studies show that just a two per cent drop in hydration levels will impair mental clarity,\" and that mental clarity comes \"when your brain enters slow wave sleep and detoxifies from beta amyloid, which causes memory loss and confusion\".She said: \"As the brain has no lymphatic system, it relies on deep sleep to clear away such neurotoxins - and studies show 70 per cent of this occurs in deep sleep.\"So, drink more water during the day.What is Olivia Arezzolo's 10-step bedtime routine? 1. Create a sleep sanctuary: Remove any blue light from iPhones and devices and keep your bedroom for sleep and relaxation. 2. Block blue light: Do not allow blue light into the bedroom and restrict this two hours from bedtime. 3. Set a goodnight alarm for your phone: At this point switch it off so you wake fully refreshed. 4. Diffuse lavender: Diffuse lavender either onto your pillows or throughout the room to promote relaxation. 5. Have an evening shower or bath: This helps to promote relaxation 45-60 minutes before bed. 6. Drink chamomile tea: Do this an hour before bed to make you calm. 7. Take a magnesium supplement: This helps the muscles to relax. 8. Practise gratitude: Think about what you are grateful for. 9. Try meditation: This can be useful to help you sleep. 10. Practise deep breathing: This makes it easier to sleep. Source: Olivia Arezzolo5. If you wake up feeling restedWaking up feeling well rested each and every morning is a great sign, according to Olivia.She says: \"You are clearly doing sufficient healthy sleep activities, like blocking blue light, sipping on chamomile tea and limiting screen time before bed.\"She also said it's vital that we realise the importance of sleep for our health, wealth and happiness as prioritising your sleep is a form of self-care.Most read in Fabulous WENDYFUL Dad gets son to build his sister a playhouse & it’s so good he’s offered job in Oz WEIGH HEY The weight loss plan Adele loves - that lets you drink wine and eat chocolate LOST & FOUND I found my family after 25 years & if it wasn’t for lockdown I’d be with them DEAD SAD Human foetus mummified 2,100 years ago in Ancient Egypt 'mistaken for a bird' CHEERS TO THAT ‘Genius’ mum puts Cheerios in a blender to make edible sandpit for her babyIn related news, we also shared what your sneeze says about you – from reserved people pinching the nose to repetition showing you want attention.Plus a sex expert says a cushion could be a ‘game-changer’ to having better orgasms.Meanwhile Stacey Solomon swears by her DIY pillow spray for helping her sleep and she made it for FREE\n",

Gavin de Becker for an unspecified amount, TMZ reported.The case could see the Amazon emperor testifying over a set of embarrassing photographs of his private parts that were allegedly \"stolen\" from Lauren's phone.Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Sanchez said as far as he is concerned Federal investigators found he had no case to answer.He said: \"Once the FBI and Amazon's own investigators cleared me of ever possessing the pictures used to blackmail Jeff, I thought I'd get a private apology, at a minimum.\"But Jeff and Lauren haven't looked back.\"I've been thrown under the bus. Sadly, it's likely the next time I see them will be in court.\"'I'AM A BEZOS' SCAPEGOAT'Sanchez claims to have been defamed by claims that he was the one to give alleged texts between 56-year-old Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez to the National Enquirer.He says he was Lauren's \"dutiful brother and manager\" when the texts were leaked.Sanchez also says in the suit he was \"scapegoated\" when a private investigator and other federal authorities probed who leaked the messages to the National Enquirer, TMZ reported.Previous reports have said the couple’s affair was exposed after Lauren allegedly showed \"flirty\" messages between her and Bezos to her brother.Sanchez also says in his suit that he received backlash from friends and business associates, and was succumbed to a raid of his house from the FBI.I've been thrown under the bus. Sadly, it's likely the next time I see them will be in court Michael Sanchez, brother of Jeff Bezos’ girlfriendBut Bezos and his security consultant insist they never specifically accused Michael Sanchez of leaking the private part pictures.A source also told the paper Sanchez was determined to have his day in court.They said he \"will air everyone's dirty laundry. Bring it on!\"The case is expected to come to court later this year.In an earlier statement to the website TMZ, Lauren said: “Michael is my older brother. He secretly provided my most personal information to the National Enquirer – a deep and unforgivable betrayal.“My family is hurting over this… we truly hope my brother finds peace.”Just a day after Bezos announced his divorce from wife MacKenzie, the alleged texts between him and his girlfriend emerged.Reports have also emerged, with claims that the Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, hacked the Amazon CEO’s phone with a corrupted message on WhatsApp.After the alleged corrupted message was sent, Bezos' phone was reportedly drained — and with that, nude pictures.Eight months after the alleged message, The National Enquirer report on Bezos' affair was leaked.5 The National Enquirer exposed Bezos' affair the day after he announced his divorce from his wife, MacKenzie Credit: AP:Associated Press5 Lauren Sanchez says her brother invaded her privacy when he exposed her messages with Bezos Credit: Getty Images - GettyMOST READ IN NEWS 'YOU DESERVED IT' ‘Racist Karen’ slapped in face after 'telling woman “go back to Mexico”' Warning HORROR DEATH Mob BURN ALIVE medic from Brit uni after accusing him of witchcraft Warning DEADLY SMASH Four kids killed in 75mph joyriding horror crash as driver, 14, arrested SHOT IN THE BACK ‘Robber’ seen being shot at 20 times in the back as he ran AWAY from cops DEATH RIDDLE Fears Freemason mum missing at sea ‘was already DEAD’ in chilling final pic KILLED HOLDING KID Woman 'shot mother in the face as victim held her one-year-old son'Bezos had also previously shared email messages between AMI, The National Enquirer's parent company, with threats over exposing nude pictures unless de Becker publicly stated the leak did not occur because of \"any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process.\"\"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrass­ment they threaten,\" Bezos said in a blog post, exposing the emails.SAUDIS LINKED TO LEAKThe claims came after the crown prince allegedly attempted to pressure Bezos into quieting coverage of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his newspaper, The Washington Post.Mid-January, the United Nations voiced concerns that the prince was responsible for hacking Bezos’ phone, and may have used a \"d**k pic\" in an attempt to silence the paper.These brings speculation that the alleged hack on Bezos' phone may have been somehow linked with The National Enquirer story.Saudi Arabia has denied the claims, calling them \"nonsense\".

            "NEWCASTLE takeover 'fixer' Amanda Staveley will be forced to put the buy-out on hold - as she faces a High Court grilling over her challenge to sue Barclays bank for a staggering £1.6 BILLION.It is the latest blow in the Toon saga with a Saudia Arabia-backed regime wanting the Premier League club in a £340million deal from Mike Ashley.2 Amanda Staveley will put the Newcastle takeover she is spearheading on hold as she is in the High Court to sue Barclays bank for £1.6 billion Credit: 2008 AFPNewcastle dealmaker Staveley is ex-model who snubbed marrying Prince AndrewStaveley has been the key figure in the takeover which has been held up by controversy with critics claiming it will allow the kingdom to \"sportswash\" its appalling human rights record.But with her out of the equation this week because of her High Court showdown, more delays will hit the buy-out.She will appear in London's High Court tomorrow and all week as she sues Barclays for £1.6bn in a high-profile case.The Yorkshire-born financier has accusing Barclays of deceit and claims she was edged out of up to £1.6billion in fees after the bank unfairly favoured other investors over her firm, PCP Capital, as the bank sought to raise £7.3bn in cash during the 2008 banking crisis.The sale of the Tynesiders has already hit trouble.MPs are in outrage over the deal because of the Saudis miserable human rights record - and are lobbying the Government to tighten restrictions on the ownership of UK football clubs by states with poor human rights records.2It is also claimed they allow illegal streaming of Premier League matches.While the latest incident to mar the possible takeover is the news that the fiancee of murdered Jamal Khashoggi, Hatice Cengiz, wants to meet Premier League chiefs before they rule on Newcastle’s takeover.Journalist Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Independent investigators claim Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was directly involved — which he denies.And now the loss of Staveley, who was working hard to push the deal through with Ashley and Prem chiefs, is another huge setback.The Daily Mail says in the High Court, Barclays bank will claim Staveley, 47, is an international finance rookie who has inflated her role in securing the Abu Dhabi investment 12 years ago to avoid a Government bail-out.In response, she is set to paint the powerbroker at the time of the huge investment, Barclays' former chief financier Roger Jenkins, as either \"reckless\" or \"dishonest\".most read in football Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge - it's the biggest hint yet he wants to stay Gossip BERN IN DESIRE Man Utd ‘ask Juve about Bernardeschi’ in case Sancho transfer bid fails Pictured 'NERVES OF STEEL' Brazil's Luiz Adriano's Wag got death threats because of their marriage Revealed BACK TO THE FUTURE Top 10 footballers of 2020 predicted in 2012 and where they are now...

            "LIVERPOOL are reportedly chasing \"unplayable\" Wolves star Adama Traore - but will have to sell some of their current crop in order to land the Spaniard.Traore, 24, has attracted plenty of interest from within the Premier League and in Spain this season.3 Liverpool are hoping to land Adama Traore this summer as a cheaper alternative to Kai Havertz or Jadon SanchoAdding goals and assists - 16 in total this term - to his ridiculous pace has injected fear into defences galore.And now the Sunday Mirror report Liverpool want to thrash out a deal.Traore signed for the Molineux club for £18million from Middlesbrough in 2018 but the Midlanders now face a task keeping hold of the winger.His performance against Liverpool earlier in the season simply could not go unnoticed and drew praise from Jurgen Klopp.The Reds boss hailed the winger as his side's transfer interest grew.Klopp said: “He is unplayable in moments, it’s unbelievable. What a player – it’s not only him but he’s so good.”Despite his Barcelona past, the Wolves ace admitted he would have no problem signing for arch-rivals Real Madrid should Los Blancos come in for him.Any club looking to land the Spaniard will need to splash the cash.There were figures of £80m or even £90m suggested for Traore but, given the current economic climate in football, £60m could be enough.However, even that may prove tricky for the reigning European champions.And it is thought the club will need to raise cash through player sales in order to help fund their incomings.Sadio Mane has been linked with a shock £131m transfer to Real Madrid but the vast majority of the Reds' valuable assets look set to be staying put at Anfield.Liverpool look set to miss out on RB Leipzig star Timo Werner after refusing to match his £53m release clause - with Chelsea swooping to get a deal done, although the Bundesliga side insist it is far from completed just yet.Klopp was also linked with Kai Havertz and Jadon Sancho, with the 20-year-olds ripping up the Bundesliga.But again, they could be priced out of moves with both players even more expensive than Werner as the cash revenues tumble due to no matchday income and season ticket refunds.Klopp told Sky Germany: \"It's rather quiet here (at Liverpool) at the moment, I think it's safe to say.\"If you want to take it seriously and run a normal business and depend on income and have no idea how much you will earn... especially because we don't know when we can start playing with spectators again.Latest transfer news Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates Gossip TIME TO SELL UP Arsenal have three weeks to land RB Leipzig's Upamecano for £53m Gossip GER GET HIM Chelsea eyeing £30m transfer swoop for Flamengo midfielder Gerson LOAN ARRANGER Arsenal flop Mkhitaryan desperate to make Roma move permanent MARCSMAN Marcos Alonso ‘likes’ tweet criticising interest in transfer target Ben Chilwell Gossip FAT CHANCE Man Utd fail in £89m bid for Barca wonderkid Fati as they 'give up' on Sancho\"At the moment, all clubs are losing money.\"Without spectators, we have to pay back the season tickets and probably sell none next year.

This will have an impact on other partners and things will look a bit different.\"Discussing with the players about things like salary waivers and on the other hand buying a player for £50-60m, we have to explain.\"3 Jurgen Klopp looks set to miss out on Timo Werner who is likely to join Chelsea instead Credit: EPA3\n",
            "WOMEN, listen up, because we might have just found the answer to all of your bedroom woes which will guarantee an epic orgasm every single time.The secret you ask? Well, according to an expert introducing a pillow or a cushion into the mix could very well cause for deeper penetration and a some serious blended orgasms.3 Nadia Bokody, 36, is a self-professed sex-positive journalist who recently revealed the sex hack in a clip on her Youtube channel. Credit: Nadia BokodyNadia Bokody, 36, is a self-professed sex-positive journalist who recently revealed the sex hack in a clip on her Youtube channel.In the video, titled “This Sex Hack Will Change Your Life”, the Aussie revealed how people can take their orgasms to the next level and guarantee mind-blowing sex every time.She said: “I discovered something that seems too good to be true but it’s real and I’m talking about sex pillows.“Sex cushions are expensive and you’re looking at hundreds of dollars, but what’s different about them is something I’ve recently discovered.“When you use a regular cushion what you’re doing is elevating your bum for penetration which we know hits the G-spot.3 She says using a pillow can elevate your orgasm to a new level Credit: Nadia Bokody“I’ve been doing it for years but when I swapped cushions it’s hugely different, the sex cushion moves a different angle.And explained: “So when he is on top of you, your G-spot is going to be hit each and every time, when I switched cushions, let’s just say I’m not using regular cushions anymore.”Nadia admitted that she wouldn’t usually purchase something seen as a gimmick - like many of us - but she said that her sex life changed dramatically when she invested in a sex pillow.The use of the pillow allows for different angles which you wouldn't normally be able to archive with some of the most common, and ordinary, sex position.3 She dubs it a \"game'changer\" Credit: Nadia BokodyNadia says that angles do matter when it comes to having mind-blowing sex, adding \"your go-to sex positions like missionary and all don’t really hit the spot all the time.She said: “By getting your body at that angle and your G-spot and clitoris is stimulated then you will have a blended orgasm.“It is going to help spice up your sex life, that’s if things have become bland, but once you have this powerful orgasm you’re going to be hungry for more.“Think about changing your sex game by adding a cushion. And there’s so many positions you can use it with.”Despite Nadia's \"game'changing\" discovery, you really don't have to spend a fortune on specific pillows.Like Nadia, you can make do with an ordinary pillow but the firmer the better to ensure it supports you and elevates your body.Most read in Fabulous WENDYFUL Dad gets son to build his sister a playhouse & it’s so good he’s offered job in Oz WEIGH HEY The weight loss plan Adele loves - that lets you drink wine and eat chocolate SLEEP TIGHT Sleep expert reveals 5 bedtime habits and tells how to get a good night's kip LOST & FOUND I found my family after 25 years & if it wasn’t for lockdown I’d be with them DEAD SAD Human foetus mummified 2,100 years ago in Ancient Egypt 'mistaken for a bird' CHEERS TO THAT ‘Genius’ mum puts Cheerios in a blender to make edible sandpit for her babyIn related news, docs say we should all masturbate during Coronavirus lockdown to ‘boost our immune systems’ & ‘fight off infections’.Plus people are warned not to masturbate with homemade sex toys after a rise in people using iPhones, cucumbers and even pestles.And you can have an orgasm when using an ab roller claims fitness trainer who says she has ‘coregasms’ all the time.\n",

If I had to go five rounds then I knew I had to be dominating and as sharp as a cactus.”After cleaning out the bantamweight and featherweight division, she said: “I don’t know [what’s next].“That was my goal to defend both belts and I don’t know what is next.“I’m very happy. I’m going to go home and call Dana White and see what’s next.”7 Spencer was left a bloody mess by the Brazilian Credit: Getty Images - Getty7 Spencer bravely battled on until the end despite a huge cut above her left eye Credit: Getty Images - GettyThe challenger’s corner told her she had just suffered a little scratch after she was cut open in the first as she was schooled by Nunes’ boxing, and every time she threw her hands back she was brutally countered.Spencer's attacks were half-hearted as she remained cautious with the champ in complete control as the buzzer went for the end of the second.The Canadian-American was proving how tough and brave she is as she went into survival mode but she failed to threaten and was more like a punchbag as the bell saved her again.Spencer was being completely outclassed still in the fourth but valiantly attempted to get in there with Nunes but unfortunately she lacked the skill-set to cause any damage.Her corner had told her she had lost the first three rounds and she has two left to get a shock submission finish.But by bell came to her rescue again at the end of the fourth as a huge haematoma continued to swell above her left eye having received 76 head shots from the champ.7 Amanda Nunes hailed her opponent's toughness after her victory Credit: Getty Images - Getty7 The Brazilian admits she does not know who is next after clearing out the featherweight and bantamweight divisionsThere were real fears the fight would be stopped before the fifth, but Spencer was allowed to continue.But despite the doctor being called in to examine her cuts, Spencer was determined to go the distance and she galliantly got to the final bell but she knew what was in store as the judges scored it unanimously in Nunes’ favour.And the 20-4-0 superstar is ready to make their soon-to-be born child her No1 priority after making her first defence in the featherweight division a triumphant one.Speaking this week ahead of her fight with Spencer, Nunes said: “Honestly my life is like watching me make history. And Saturday I’m going to follow that path, make history. Being a mother comes with it.“I feel like everybody can be a mother, I feel like a lot of people have a problem if you’re a mother of course.

However Andrew denies this.But now The Sun can reveal the US Department of Justice has dramatically upped the stakes.It has by-passed Buckingham Palace - instead filing a “mutual legal assistance” (MLA) request to the Home Office.MLA requests are only used in criminal cases under a legal treaty with the UK.It means Andrew, who “categorically denies” any wrongdoing, could now be forced to appear in a UK court as a witness within months.The move also piles pressure on the Duke to give evidence - and on the UK Government to assist.'DIPLOMATIC NIGHTMARE'The Sun understands no decision on the explosive request has yet been made by British officials.And sources said it was unlikely Andrew would be aware of the MLA request at this stage because countries are legally obliged to keep them secret.But a source said: “It’s a huge statement of intent from the US and it moves Andrew into the realms of a criminal investigation.“It’s also frankly a diplomatic nightmare.14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14 Credit: PA:Press Association“The DoJ does not make a request of this nature lightly, especially one involving a senior member of the British royal family.“It puts the UK government in a very difficult position - and the Duke of York even even more so.”The Sun has learned the request was formally lodged by the DoJ last month under the terms of a 1994 MLA treaty.If granted, US prosecutors would have two options.The first, typically only used for witnesses to crimes, would see the Duke asked to voluntarily attend an interview and give a signed statement. Crucially, this would NOT be under oath.The DoJ does not make a request of this nature lightly, especially one involving a senior member of the British royal family.But sources say angry American investigators - frustrated at what they see as a lack of cooperation from the Queen’s son to date - have the power to pursue an explosive second route.That would see Andrew asked to attend London’s City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court to provide oral or written evidence on oath.If he refused, the Duke could be forced to attend in person by summons, with DoJ lawyers able to quiz him.Andrew, unlike the Queen, does not hold sovereign immunity from prosecution.But any evidence session could be held “in camera” - privately, with no press or public present.He would still have the right to “take the Fifth” by staying silent to avoid self-incrimination.MLA requests filed to the UK in criminal matters are always dealt with by the Home Office.1414 Credit: PA:Press AssociationThey are rarely used in civil matters, but if they are, any request has to be filed to the Foreign Office instead.American legal experts have already warned that any decision by Andrew to remain silent could badly backfire.Last month ex-federal prosecutor Evan T Barr told a top US law journal: “While the Prince would retain the right to decline to testify under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the impact on his already diminished reputation would be considerable and an adverse inference could be drawn against him in the related civil litigations, leading to a possible default judgment.”CAREER IN RUINSAndrew stepped down as a senior royal after his disastrous Newsnight interview last November.It aimed to clear the air, but the “car crash” exchange with BBC presenter Emily Maitlis instead has seen his career left in ruins.During the interview, Andrew said he would help the US investigation if his “legal advice was to do so”.But in January, Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York leading the Epstein inquiry, said the Duke had “provided zero co-operation”.Two months later Mr Berman said the Duke had “now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation”.And in a hint of what was to come, Mr Berman warned: “Our office is considering its options.”Andrew’s aides hit back, insisting his lawyers had been in touch with prosecutors since the beginning of the year.Mr Berman’s office admitted there had been “communications through his attorneys”.But they said Andrew’s lawyers had made it clear he was still “not willing to submit to an interview”.14 Credit: PA:Press Association14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14The deadlock led US legal experts to warn the Prince would face “significant pressure going forward to cooperate with the US authorities”.Some even predicted the DoJ could eventually lodge an MLA request to question the Duke as a witness.Andrew has admitted being pals with Epstein since 1999 after being introduced by socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein was a guest at Ghislaine’s birthday party at Sandringham.He also attended Beatrice’s 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle, just two months after a warrant was issued for his arrest for sexual assault of a minor.Andrew and Epstein met on at least ten occasions and the Duke stayed over at Epstein’s New York mansion, Palm Beach home and on a private island in the US Virgin Islands.Alleged victim Virgina Roberts Giuffre says she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Andrew in London in 2001.She described Andrew as “sweating profusely” at Tramp nightclub before having sex at Ghislaine’s Mayfair flat.Andrew later told Newsnight a “peculiar medical condition” meant he did not sweat.And he insisted he did not go clubbing, claiming he remembered because he had been at Woking Pizza Express earlier that day.He claims he has no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre and sources close to the Prince have even suggested a photo with his arm around Giuffre at Maxwell’s flat could have been faked.Giuffre also alleges that Epstein paid her around £300 to have sex with Andrew at Epstein’s New York mansion.14 Credit: Getty14 Credit: AP:Associated Press14 Credit: ReutersIn evidence to a Florida court in 2015, she claimed to have had an orgy with Andrew and eight other girls at Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands.Epstein was jailed in Florida in 2008 after being convicted for procuring an underage girl for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.FIVE ACCUSERSJust 18 months after his release from jail in 2010, Epstein gave the Duchess of York £15,000 to pay off her debts.Andrew was pictured staying at the convicted sex offender’s New York mansion for three nights later that year.He claimed he made the trip to end the friendship face-to-face, saying it was a “convenient place to stay”.Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell last August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Five accusers want to give evidence about Andrew in US courts.Pre-trial witness subpoenas have been prepared for five cases and could be served on Andrew if he ever set foot in the US.Since stepping down as a senior royal Prince Andrew has recruited his own legal and PR teams to fight the case.He has reportedly hired Clare Montgomery QC, a top barrister who previously represented Chilean dictator General Pinochet.In the article for the respected New York Law Journal last month, Mr Barr predicted Andrew’s lawyers would view his “safest approach is to hunker down in the UK”.And the top US lawyer warned: “As a result of his BBC interview, the Prince has ‘locked himself in’ to a version of events, including some highly specific alibis, that leave him little room to adapt should new evidence come to light.“Thus, even if he does agree to testify before a grand jury or more likely participating in an informal proffer session, he risks possible perjury or false statement charges, not to mention likely leaks to the media.“Notwithstanding the fact that the Prince is a member of a royal family that enjoys close ties with the United States, he lacks any formal diplomatic or sovereign immunity and is facing a prosecutor who has already shown a willingness to pursue high profile foreign leaders such as the former President of Venezuela.”Tonight the Home Office said: “As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.”14 Credit: BBC\", 'news'], ['DREW Brees\\' wife apologized for his \"insensitive\"

which hosted the 2014 final between city rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - is the likely host after being backed by the Portuguese FA.Portugal has been among the European nations least affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, so could even allow fans into the stadium by August.Lisbon was chosen because it has several modern stadiums that are suitable to host a tournament, having staged Euro 2004.The city has both the Estadio Da Luz - home of Benfica - and the Estadio Jose Alvalade - where Sporting Lisbon play their home games.The move falls in line with Uefa's political demands and with no Portuguese sides left in the competition, it would not be seen to give an unfair advantage to any team.Frankfurt appears to be the second favourite after the German association proposed it be used to finish the tournament.But with RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich still in the running for the continent's top prize, Uefa bosses fear a German city would effectively give them home advantage.Russian footballing authorities also suggested the use of Moscow.But it is reported Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin would not consider the country due to its high number of virus cases.A location for the revised end to the tournament will be officially announced on June 17 at a Uefa meeting.The European champions were initially set to be crowned in Istanbul on May 30 but Covid-19 brought world football to a halt in March.It is claimed that Europe's governing body and the Turkish city have been in talks regarding the situation.A lack of travelling fans is likely to mean they are unable to cash in on the investment of hosting the showpiece final, allowing the unique finish to go ahead elsewhere.Four Last 16 ties are still yet to have their second leg played but Atleti, Leipzig, Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta have all booked their spot in the quarters.MOST READ IN FOOTBALL Comment DAVE KIDD Pep appointing Lillo as No 2 is huge -

That’s a possibility.\"And with the cat now out of the bag, Aussie promoter Dean Lonergan has claimed credit for the proposal.The man that brought Manny Pacquiao Down Under to fight Jeff Horn told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"When Bob came out and said that we are talking to \\'our friends in Australia\\', I’m the one he’s talking to.I just had a thought six weeks ago that if these guys can’t do a major fight in Las Vegas or New York, why not come down here where I know we can get a crowd.

It’s who Muhammad Ali took his lead off.\"He set the platform for African-American success in sports.“His importance has been overlooked over the past 112 years.\"What he did in 1908 was historically significant. Wouldn\\'t it be totally amazing to get two recent heavyweight champions down here, two of the best self-promoters in the business, to celebrate Jack Johnson’s achievements from 112 years ago.”The first two Fury-Wilder fights were the biggest promotions of Arum\\'s illustrious career, but Lonergan believes that his strong relationship with the veteran American could be key in securing the third.5 Jack Johnson (right) became the first African-American heavyweight title-holder in Sydney on Boxing Day 1908 Credit: Times Newspapers LtdLATEST BOXING NEWS Live Blog TOON LATEST Newcastle takeover LIVE: Staveley battle with Barclays, Bin Salman LATEST Breaking EFL HEAVEN AND HELL EFL clubs will be promoted and relegated if season is ended early Live Blog COVID IN SPORT Windies touch down for Tests, Ronnie ready to return & Prem spies on lookout Pictured 30 LOVE Ex-Wimbledon champ Ilie Nastase, 73, marries FIFTH wife who is 30 years his junior Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates SLY MOVE Stallone backs McGregor to become part owner of UFC and offers some of his shareHe said: \"It’s an excellent relationship, I have enormous respect for Bob since he came down here with Manny Pacquiao.\"We’ve done a few deals like when Jeff fought Terence Crawford.

by offering £36m instead.Van de Beek came through the academy at Ajax and has racked up 41 goals in 175 first-team appearances.MAN UTD NEWS LIVE: Follow for the latest United newsHe still has two years left to run on his current contract but the Eredivisie side - who were denied the title when the season was suspended - face a battle to keep hold of him once again.For Real Madrid, he could be seen as a long-term replacement to the likes of Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, 34 and 30 respectively.Zinedine Zidane has also been a long-term admirer of compatriot Paul Pogba, who would play in a similar central midfield role to Van de Beek if he joined from Old Trafford.The two heavyweights are also battling it out for two other bright young talents.Reports this weekend stated Los Blancos' offer of £71m for Kai Havertz, 20, and the chance to loan him back to Bayer Leverkusen for next season were rejected by the Bundesliga side.United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Bayern Munich are also being linked with Havertz.Latest transfer news Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates Gossip TIME TO SELL UP Arsenal have three weeks to land RB Leipzig's Upamecano for £53m Gossip GER GET HIM Chelsea eyeing £30m transfer swoop for Flamengo midfielder Gerson LOAN ARRANGER Arsenal flop Mkhitaryan desperate to make Roma move permanent MARCSMAN Marcos Alonso ‘likes’ tweet criticising interest in transfer target Ben Chilwell Gossip FAT CHANCE Man Utd fail in £89m bid for Barca wonderkid Fati as they 'give up' on SanchoAnd 17-year-old Eduardo Camavinga is at the centre of a tug of war between the Red Devils and Real Madrid, too.Rennes' teenage sensation is already being tipped for big things in the game so both clubs are desperate not to miss out and could offer in the region of £25m for the holding midfielder.However, the Ligue 1 side, who have qualified for the Champions League, set their asking price at around £60m for their youngest first-team debutant.33\", 'sport'], ['A DIVER has braved sub-zero temperatures to get shots of creepy lifeforms five-hundred-feet below the surface.The alien-looking creatures include a luminescent ‘lion\\'s mane’ jellyfish and an intestine-like golden ragworm.10 This pink Hyperia galba is a rare species of zooplankton Credit: mediadrumimages/AlexanderSemenov/AquatilisMarine biologist and photographer Alexander Semenov captured the amazing images.The 34-year-old from Moscow had to brave temperatures of minus one point five degrees celsius at the White Sea Biological Station, Russia, off the Kandalaksha Bay.He said: \"When you see a lion’s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) with over three feet dome diameter and over forty-nine feet of tentacles, in complete darkness -

China has been accused of attempting to cover up the outbreak Credit: Getty Images - GettyA social media post from a researcher in Guangzhou said scientists instantly knew the new pathogen resembled the Sars-coronavirus which caused an outbreak in 2003, Caixin reports.The report claims the lab “assembled a nearly complete viral genome sequence” on Dec 27 and passed their finding to Chinese authorities.Another lab found how the virus was transmitted while a third found it was similar to Sars after carrying out gene-sequencing on a sample on Dec 29.Last week, leaked recording from WHO meetings revealed health officials\\' shock over Beijing\\'s failure to release data immediately.At least one study has found that if the communist regime had acted three weeks earlier, it would have cut infected cases by 95 per cent.In May, a spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.3 A wet market in Guangzhou, China, selling turtles for food. The Covid-19 outbreak is believed to have started at a market in Wuhan Credit: EPAA 15-page document, obtained by Australia\\'s The Saturday Telegraph, laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.It has also been revealed that a laboratory in Wuhan, not far from the now infamous wet market, had been studying deadly bat-derived coronaviruses.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that China\\'s secrecy surrounding the virus led to an \"assault on international transparency\".Another report claims the CIA believes China threatened the WHO into delaying warnings about Covid-19 while it hoarded medical supplies.\\'PRESSURE ON WHO\\'According to the document, Beijing told the World Health Organisation they would stop working with them if the agency declared a global health emergency.The alleged pressure in January enabled China to stockpile crucial medical equipment while the coronavirus - which started in Wuhan late last year - spread around the world, reports Newsweek.Two US intelligence sources confirmed the contents of the CIA report, titled \\'U.N.-China: WHO Mindful But Not Beholden to China,\\' to Newsweek.Most read in News Warning HORROR DEATH Mob BURN ALIVE medic from Brit uni after accusing him of witchcraft \\'YOU DESERVED IT\\' ‘Racist Karen’ slapped in face after \\'telling woman “go back to Mexico”\\' Warning DEADLY SMASH Four kids killed in 75mph joyriding horror crash as driver, 14, arrested SHOT IN THE BACK ‘Robber’ seen being shot at 20 times in the back as he ran AWAY from cops DEATH RIDDLE Fears Freemason mum missing at sea ‘was already DEAD’ in chilling final pic MAKING THEM PAY Kobe’s wife seeks hundreds of millions in damages over chopper crash deathA third intelligence report, this time from German spies, claims Xi Jinping personally pressured the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus into downplaying the risk of the virus.Newspaper Der Spiegel cited sources from Munich\\'s Federal Intelligence Service, known as the \\'Bundesnachrichtendienst\\' (BND).The WHO has branded the claims “unfounded and untrue.”', 'news'], ['SLEEP is something that is commonly overlooked, and while we\\'re all a fan of some good quality shut-eye, a lot of people aren\\'t getting the quality sleep they need.A sleep expert has revealed what your sleeping patterns actually mean and explains the real reasons behind feeling foggy and broken snoozes.4 Sleep expert Olivia Arezzolo explains what your sleeping habits mean Credit: InstagramSydney-based Olivia Arezzolo, who boats 36.6k followers on Instagram, confirms that sleep deprivation can really take a toll on our well-being and can affect our behaviour and performance during the day.Speaking to Femail, the sleep guru explained five different sleeping habits, what they mean and how you can improve your shut-eye with a bedtime routine.1. If you struggle to get to sleepWe might all occasion have a restless night here and there, but if it happens frequently Olivia said you might want to re-think your sleep.She said: \"This could mean that you\\'re doing insufficient healthy sleep activities like you don\\'t have a relaxing routine the hour before you go to bed.\"4 You should be able to fall asleep with ease Credit: AlamyThe expert said that it could also mean you\\'re doing \"sleep sabotaging\" activities - like watching TV before bed, napping too late in the day or having caffeine or chocolate in the afternoon.She explained: \"In the absence of light, you produce melatonin — helping you stay asleep. In the presence of light, you produce cortisol — helping you stay awake. Whilst this is ideal during the day, it\\'s obviously not in the evening.\"She suggests limiting time on your phone in the evenings, but if it\\'s persists, she says to a hormone imbalance could be the reason - \"driven by conditions such as PCOS, an overactive thyroid, depression and anxiety disorders\".2. If you wake up in the middle of the nightYou might fall asleep right away but waking up in the middle of the night is also a bad sign, and Olivia says stress is often to blame.Feeling anxious or having trouble switching off can still affect you even after you doze off because stresses increase the levels or cortisol in your body.4 Olivia explains what you can do to get better sleep Credit: oliviaarezzolo/Instagram\"Cortisol levels naturally spike due to your circadian rhythm, which means if you\\'re stressed out and have higher than normal levels of cortisol (or if you\\'re going through menopause), you\\'ll wake up,\" Olivia said.The expert said it could also mean you\\'re drinking too much alcohol with Olivia saying, despite alcohol being a sedative, it often has a \"rebound effect\" and can \"wake you up with a flurry of thoughts.\"3. If you power through on just a few hours\\' sleepSome people feel they only need a few hours sleep but Olivia explained that the concept of \"powering through\" is largely a fallacy.\"Sleep deprivation impairs the frontal lobe, responsible for decision making, judgement and mental productivity,\" she said, so even if you feel invincible, Olivia says \"you are likely to be slower as a result of too little sleep\".And added: \"Because your judgement is impaired, you won\\'t always realise that you\\'re being inefficient,\" meaning you work could be slipping and you don\\'t even realise it.The answer is to prioritise sleep and aim for between seven to nine hours every night.4 Lack of sleep slows you down Credit: Getty Images - Getty4. If you wake up feeling foggy regardless of how much sleep you getBrain fog is common for a lot of people - and it often comes back to your sleep and hydration.The sleeping guru says that \"brain fog can be attributed to a number of factors\" and dehydration is one that\\'s often overlooked.She explained: \"Studies show that just a two per cent drop in hydration levels will impair mental clarity,\" and that mental clarity comes \"when your brain enters slow wave sleep and detoxifies from beta amyloid, which causes memory loss and confusion\".She said: \"As the brain has no lymphatic system, it relies on deep sleep to clear away such neurotoxins - and studies show 70 per cent of this occurs in deep sleep.\"So, drink more water during the day.What is Olivia Arezzolo\\'s 10-step bedtime routine? 1. Create a sleep sanctuary: Remove any blue light from iPhones and devices and keep your bedroom for sleep and relaxation. 2. Block blue light: Do not allow blue light into the bedroom and restrict this two hours from bedtime. 3. Set a goodnight alarm for your phone: At this point switch it off so you wake fully refreshed. 4. Diffuse lavender: Diffuse lavender either onto your pillows or throughout the room to promote relaxation. 5. Have an evening shower or bath: This helps to promote relaxation 45-60 minutes before bed. 6. Drink chamomile tea: Do this an hour before bed to make you calm. 7. Take a magnesium supplement: This helps the muscles to relax. 8. Practise gratitude: Think about what you are grateful for. 9. Try meditation: This can be useful to help you sleep. 10. Practise deep breathing: This makes it easier to sleep. Source: Olivia Arezzolo5. If you wake up feeling restedWaking up feeling well rested each and every morning is a great sign, according to Olivia.She says: \"You are clearly doing sufficient healthy sleep activities, like blocking blue light, sipping on chamomile tea and limiting screen time before bed.\"She also said it\\'s vital that we realise the importance of sleep for our health, wealth and happiness as prioritising your sleep is a form of self-care.Most read in Fabulous WENDYFUL Dad gets son to build his sister a playhouse & it’s so good he’s offered job in Oz WEIGH HEY The weight loss plan Adele loves - that lets you drink wine and eat chocolate LOST & FOUND I found my family after 25 years & if it wasn’t for lockdown I’d be with them DEAD SAD Human foetus mummified 2,100 years ago in Ancient Egypt \\'mistaken for a bird\\' CHEERS TO THAT ‘Genius’ mum puts Cheerios in a blender to make edible sandpit for her babyIn related news, we also shared what your sneeze says about you – from reserved people pinching the nose to repetition showing you want attention.Plus a sex expert says a cushion could be a ‘game-changer’ to having better orgasms.Meanwhile Stacey Solomon swears by her DIY pillow spray for helping her sleep and she made it for FREE', 'lifestyle'], ['A POLISH bare-knuckle boxer nicknamed \"Tyson\" lived up to his reputation with a sickening KO blow.Krystian Kuzma booked his place in the Gromba heavyweight final as he floored Lukasz ‘Brodacz’ Zaluska in extraordinary fashion.4 Krystian Kuzma delivered a devastating KO during his bare-knuckle fighting semi-final on Saturday night Credit: Twitter@mieszankabang4 His big right hand and then uppercut sent Lukasz ‘Brodacz’ Zaluska crashing to the canvas Credit: Twitter@mieszankabangAnd the knockout was so brutal, his opponent had to leave on a stretcher.In the event specifically designed for brutal knockouts - there is no time limit in the fifth and final round - Kuzma ensured viewers were not left disappointed.He went straight on to the attack after the first bell, taking the fight to Zaluska.And with less than 30 seconds on the clock, Kuzma closed in on a stunning victory.A huge right hand put \\'Brodacz\\' on the back foot and stumbling.Then Kuzma followed it up with a brutal uppercut, sending his poleaxed opponent crashing to the canvas face first and unable to break his fall.Zaluska remained on the deck for several minutes receiving medical attention as Kuzma celebrated booking his place in the final later on Saturday night.And once again he stormed to victory to claim the title with another first-round stoppage in the savage fighting sport.TYSON NOT TEMPTEDKuzma\\'s idol Iron Mike was offered the chance to take up bare-knuckle boxing as he plots a stunning comeback to the ring.As videos emerged of the 53-year-old American getting back into shape and working on the pads, BKBFC chief David Feldman made a tempting proposal with £16million on the table.Feldman said: “Look, Mike Tyson, at his age, I don’t think he can do ten three-minute rounds, this is five two-minute rounds.“It’s a little different than what he’s use to, but it’s a shorter timeframe and I think it’s something that would really fit his fighting style and his age group right now.\"Tyson, though, may prefer to return to what he is used to and step back inside the ring for a regular boxing fight - all in the name of charity.A trilogy bout with Evander Holyfield is on the cards.No fight has yet been agreed between the pair, who met twice in the 1990s, but Tyson is keen to get an exhibition arranged.Latest boxing news Live Blog TOON LATEST Newcastle takeover LIVE: Staveley battle with Barclays, Bin Salman LATEST Breaking EFL HEAVEN AND HELL EFL clubs will be promoted and relegated if season is ended early Live Blog COVID IN SPORT Windies touch down for Tests, Ronnie ready to return & Prem spies on lookout Pictured 30 LOVE Ex-Wimbledon champ Ilie Nastase, 73, marries FIFTH wife who is 30 years his junior Live Blog BLUES NEWS Chelsea news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Stamford Bridge Live Blog UNITED LATEST Man Utd news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford Live Blog GUNNERS LATEST Arsenal news LIVE: Follow all the latest updates from the Emirates SLY MOVE Stallone backs McGregor to become part owner of UFC and offers some of his shareHe told TMZ Sport: “That would be awesome for charity.
